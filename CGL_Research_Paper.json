This study aimed to establish the interand intra-rater reliability of a commercially available fixed frame dynamometer in measuring peak isometric neck strength. A convenience sample of male (n = 16) and female (n = 20) university students performed maximal isometric contractions for flexion (Flex), extension (Ext), left- (LSF) and right-side flexion (RSF) in a quadruped position over three sessions. The intra-rater reliability results were good-to-excellent for both males (ICC = 0.83\u20130.90) and females (ICC = 0.86\u20130.94) and acceptable (CV < 15%) across all directions for both males and females. The inter-rater reliability results were excellent (ICC = 0.96\u20130.97) and acceptable (CV < 11.1%) across all directions. Findings demonstrated a significant effect for sex (p \u2264 0.05): males were stronger in all four directions, and a significant effect for direction (p \u2264 0.05): Ext tested stronger (193 N) than Flex (176 N), LSF (130 N) and RSF (125 N). The findings show that the VALD fixed frame dynamometer can reliably assess isometric neck strength and can provides reference values for healthy males and females."},

Some of these studies have analysed story structures in terms of Labov and Waletzky\u2019s model (1967) or the more elaborate model developed by Martin (2008). Such models work well for stories that recount events that took place in past time, but they do not capture another type of story, the hypothetical scenario, sufficiently well. Drawing on prior research into stories in lecture discourse, and \u2018Imagining Scenarios\u2019 (\u00c4del 2010, 2012), we identify and describe passages in lectures where listeners are invited to imagine a fantastic hypothetical situation. Scenario identification criteria were developed, and examples were extracted from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus, the Engineering Lecture Corpus (ELC), and the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE). Novice EMI lecturers may understandably be nervous about straying away from the delivery of facts and into the realms of fantasy, but our findings suggest that scenario-telling is part of the experienced lecturer\u2019s repertoire, and is an engaging way of elaborating abstract technical terms, concepts, or arguments central to a disciplinary topic."},

Corpus linguistic approaches enable examination of large bodies of language data based on computing power. These bodies of data, or corpora, facilitate investigation of the meaning of words in context. The semi-automated nature of such investigation helps researchers to identify and interpret language patterns that might otherwise be inaccessible through manual analysis. We illustrate potential uses of corpus linguistic approaches through four short case studies by higher education researchers, spanning educational contexts, disciplines and genres. These case studies are underpinned by discussion of the development of corpus linguistics as a field of investigation, including existing open corpora and corpus analysis tools. We give a flavour of how corpus linguistic techniques, in isolation or as part of a wider research approach, can be particularly helpful to higher education researchers who wish to investigate language data and its context."},

Recent investigation of student degree outcomes in the UK indicates that this disparity, whereby White students are awarded higher degree qualifications than BAME students, at its starkest sits at around 20% nationwide (OfS 2018). This gap in academic outcomes increases during the HE journey of these particular student populations, despite sector-wide recognition of systemic inequality (UUK and NUS 2019).Our work therefore seeks to better understand institutional practices and policies that may contribute to this ethnic attainment disparity. We specifically attempt to unpick the ways in which the \u2018written feedback information\u2019 (Boud 2013) that students receive may be connected to their degree award outcomes. This focus has two main drivers: 1. written feedback information given to assessed work is one of the main channels through which lecturers engage formally with individual students, throughout students\u2019 HE journey, and 2. students at local and national levels have voiced ongoing dissatisfaction with feedback and assessment practices, disproportionate to other satisfaction indicators (e.g. National Student Survey results (OfS 2019)).We previously looked at whether differences in the nature of written feedback information can be differentiated according to the variable of discipline, for which we developed a framework of feedback functions (Alsop and Gardner 2019). This framework is comprised of five main functions (\u2018advice\u2019, \u2018critique\u2019, \u2018observation\u2019, \u2018praise\u2019, \u2018query\u2019) and a catchall \u2018unclassified\u2019 option. Each function is subdivided three times, firstly by focus (e.g. \u2018advice\u2019 splits into \u2018suggestion\u2019 and \u2018instruction\u2019), then by orientation (\u2018specific\u2019 or \u2018general\u2019), and then by aspect (\u2018future\u2019 or \u2018present\u2019). We found that it was possible to differentiate the nature of the written feedback information received by individual students based on the variable of discipline.In this paper, we explore further whether we can use this framework as a starting point to investigate whether a relationship exists between students\u2019 ethnicity and language patterns within the written feedback information they receive. To do so, we applied our framework to 50 texts written to students from different ethnic backgrounds within a single discipline in a post-92 HE institution in the UK. Each file in the small corpus includes the feedback text written by the instructor to the student, and also metadata information about that student. Metadata variables include socioeconomic information (such as \u2018ethnicity\u2019, \u2018gender\u2019, and \u2018home postcode\u2019) and academic information (such as \u2018assignment grade\u2019, \u2018discipline\u2019, and \u2018level of study\u2019). The variable of ethnicity is self-identified when students apply to HE institutions in the UK (see HESA 2018). After manually encoding all texts, using individual comments as the unit of analysis, we looked at the relationship between students\u2019 ethnicity, grade attained, and the language of the written feedback that they receive.We will discuss findings from the analysis of this small dataset. Preliminary results indicate that little differentiation is evident in terms of the categorisation of written feedback information at the highest level of overall function in relation to binary categories of self-identified ethnicity (BAME and White). A more granular investigation of feedback function at the level of focus and orientation indicates some differentiation in the language of the feedback written to White and BAME student populations. Further differentiation is evident in the language of written feedback information at the level of overall function between the distinct ethnic populations that comprise the broad BAME category. Overall, there is greater differentiation in the language of written feedback information at the level of particular functions within BAME populations than between White and BAME populations.As part of a wider research project, what this stage of analysis confirms is the importance of granularity when investigating institutional practices and student academic outcomes. In the context of the ethnic attainment gap, we do not propose a direct causal relationship between the language of written feedback information and student ethnicity, but rather suggest that written feedback information may constitute one means by which certain (already disadvantaged) groups of students are further, and cumulatively, disengaged by higher education practices.Analysis also resulted in minor amendments to the 2019 working feedback framework; we added \u2018neutral\u2019 as a branch of the aspect attribute, alongside \u2018present\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019. This amendment is intended to capture more finely lecturer intention so that we can later compare this to student perceptions, which we anticipate will be a productive gap to explore.This small study gives us confidence to progress to the next stage in our broader research project, which is to extend both the scale of the corpus and also the method of analysis to include investigation of the intersection of impacting variables.ReferencesBoud, D.

For example, students who declared their ethnicity as Black were 20% less likely to graduate with a top classification than those who declared their ethnicity as White (OfS, 2018a). The causes of such attainment gaps are complex, and one important factor may be the nature of the feedback given by academic staff on assignments written by different groups of students. This paper aims to explore the feasibility of investigating this hypothesis by analyzing written feedback and looking for patterns in feedback given to different groups of students. Literature Review: Research on attainment among Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students in the UK has explored a number of aspects, and has generally concluded that there are issues of \u201cbelonging\u201d (Richardson, 2015), particularly in institutions where the majority of academic staff and students are White, but that no single variable can explain the disparity. The wording of feedback on lower-scoring papers has been shown to be more impersonal and distant than that given to students on higher-scoring papers (e.g., Gardner, 2004), which has the (unintended) result of increasing the sense of belonging of higher performing students in ways that can build incrementally over the years of a degree course. While there have been many such small-scale studies of written feedback, none have aimed to collect large quantities of authentic written feedback for analysis. \nResearch Questions: The hypotheses that\u202fdrive our exploration are that\u202fwritten feedback information (WFI) (Boud & Malloy, 2013) is\u202fworded differently to different groups of students, and that there is a direct relationship between this aspect of feedback and academic attainment as measured by grades on summative assessments. Specifically, we asked: \n1.\tCan a framework of WFI functions be developed for our data that share a meaningful set of attributes? \n2.\tCan these categories be used to differentiate WFI to different groups of students?\nMethodology: A small pilot corpus was compiled from written feedback comments on twelve student assignments from two large Faculties. Metadata was added to each file, and the WFI comments were annotated and analyzed according to a framework developed in a branching format through a recursive construction process informed by the literature reviewed and the data in the corpus. This technique was used to characterize the WFI styles of the two Faculties. \nResults: The results show that all WFI comments could be classified using the novel systematic framework developed, and that its binary nature enabled ready cross-tabulation with metadata variables. Praise and critique were found to be most frequent, with specific praise of ideas (P1A) accounting for 68% of all praise, and specific critique of content (C1A) accounting for 49% of all critique. Observations tend to be the longest feedback comments (average 15.4 words). When the two Faculties are compared, two different feedback styles are evident, with Fac1 providing more advice, query, and observation style feedback than Fac2, and Fac2 providing more praise and critique than Fac1. \n"},

The analysis looks at 76 English-medium lectures from the UK, Malaysia, and New Zealand, which form part of the Engineering Lecture Corpus. Differences in preferred humour type, amount, and laughter response rate are evident across the three cultural subcorpora.

The corpus contains, therefore, only texts that have met departmental requirements for the given level of study. University writing programmes are typically aimed at undergraduate and Master's students, and it would be useful for writing tutors to know more about student assignment genres and the linguistic features of successful writing at undergraduate and Master's level.

To address the challenges with conducting qualitative research for its own staff and students, An-Najah National University (West Bank) collaborated with Coventry University (UK) to design and deliver a joint researcher-development programme on the uses of qualitative research methods, and the process and requirements of scholarly publication. Whilst implementing the programme, the team of British and Palestinian academics sought to examine the socio-cultural challenges of capacity-building between higher education institutions in the Global North and South \u2013 specifically in relation to qualitative research practice \u2013 and answer the question of how an equitable partnership between Global North and South institutions can be built. By engaging in Action Research, the North-South collaborators observed and analysed how Western researcher-development practices and assumptions were questioned, re-examined and adapted to give rise to a near-symmetrical relationship between the two institutions."},

According to this premise, the pedagogic validity of any other mode of tutoring depends on how accurately it replicates the \u201cideal\u201d conditions of face-to-face interaction. Following this logic, the asynchronous writing tutorial comes last in the hierarchy of preferred tutorial formats. This chapter offers a different perspective on asynchronous online writing tutoring based on the teaching practices in place at the Centre for Academic Writing (CAW), Coventry University, England. It develops a new theoretical framework for existing tutorial practices and suggests juxtaposition through parenthetical comments as a pedagogically-sound strategy for teaching critical thinking in asynchronous online student-tutor communication and potentially in other teaching contexts. Our analysis relies on Bakhtin\u2019s understanding of language as intrinsically dialogic and applies this concept to the academic discourse of asynchronous writing tutorials."},

We used quantitative analysis for data collected from 371 questionnaires in the city of Beirut. The results indicate that consumers have, in general, low confidence in their knowledge of organic food, despite being well informed about it. Whilst objective knowledge has a significant positive effect on consumers\u2019 attitudes towards organic food, subjective knowledge has a negative effect. Women are more aware than men about organic food and younger consumers tend to have higher objective knowledge than mature ones. As subjective and objective knowledge and the resulting attitudes of consumers are influenced by sources of information, marketing campaigns and strategies need to emphasize the fact that the attributes of organic food are distinguished from those of conventional foods, using credible information channels. While subjective and objective knowledge of organic food have not been studied previously in our target region, we believe that unlike most previous research which studied the role of knowledge in organic food acceptance and consumption, our study aims to assess and explore this relationship using two different variables (subjective and objective knowledge)."},

In the current study, we tested the impact of (EI) on (LE) and the moderating role of gender on this relationship. We employed Hierarchical Moderated Multiple Regression analysis (MMR) for our data, which we collected from 141 questionnaires using a non-probabilistic technique from Fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) in Egypt. We found that EI is positively related to LE. The gender variable moderated both the relationship between others\u2019 emotional appraisal and LE and use of emotion and LE. Specifically, others\u2019 emotional appraisal was positively associated with LE for females, but almost unrelated for males; whereas the positive relationship between use of emotion and LE was stronger for males compared to females. The current study highlights the crucial role that human resource development and training would play in augmenting EI skills for both female and male leaders in general, and how each gender needs to better develop understanding on the other gender emotional positions. Our data was collected from a small sample of only two organizations, which hinders our ability in generalizing the findings to other organizations. While conducting future research, these aspects should be kept in mind, which can provide more valuable results. Conducting this study in Egypt contributes to the international learning experience on EI and LE in countries other than Western ones."},

Where possible, in order to maximise resource impact and minimise organisational disruption, HEIs should practically map these DEN to processes, roles, events, activities, channels, and technologies (PRE-ACTs) that already exist within the organisation. The paper iteratively considers use of additional practical approaches that need be considered in order to ensure that strategic HEI CRM DEN are effectively captured, and that the requirements are appropriately mapped to existing HEI activities.Design/methodology/approach: Content from 27 JISC cases, 10 semi-structured interviews and three focus group sessions have been collected and analysed using thematic analysis to understand how to develop preliminary stage 2 steps and assess the applicability of the final CRM strategy orientation support (CRM-SOS) framework stage 2 methods.Findings: The authors believe that this study provides substantial practical support to CRM implementation practitioners when analysing customer CRM desires, expectation, and needs requirements.

We collected data through an online survey from 105 students (control and experimental) and performed interviews with two focus groups of students. We identified the GFC learning approach as more efficient in terms of complexity of the technique, task orientation, student engagement, satisfaction, knowledge, and learning motivation. We also found a slight difference between the two approaches in terms of student skill development. Surprisingly, the control group achieved better course learning outcomes through TC than the experimental group using GFC because of perceived content relevance.

We employed a survey research design using a self-developed questionnaire targeting first-year students in private universities in Kurdistan. Using a sample of 518 students and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), we found that the university characteristics that most influenced student choice were reputation/accreditation, quality of teaching, employability and quality of facilities, a finding consistent with existing literature. However, cost of study was not seen to be highly influential in relation to student choice. Accordingly, the study recommends that universities consider increasing their tuition fees and dedicating the extra revenues to boosting their reputation, enhancing their quality of teaching and accreditation and increasing their connection to and relationships with local employers.

Although existing research agrees that intensive attention should be given to CRM planning, there is no consensus or developed framework, for use within HEIs, demonstrating how CRM strategy can be orientated to align with university strategies and customer needs."},

This paper investigates the main barriers of organizational inclusion practices of academics in Egyptian higher education institutions, and proposes interventions to enhance academics' sense of organizational inclusion. METHODS: A total of 350 academics were contacted and 245 of them were interviewed in 49 face-to-face focus groups. The interview length for each focus group is about 45 minutes and is conducted in Arabic, the mother tongue of all respondents. Upon conducting the interviews, the authors used thematic analysis to determine the main ideas in the transcripts. RESULTS: After carefully analyzing the interviews, the authors of this paper could not identify any adoptable paradigm for the systematic practice of organizational inclusion experienced by academics in the chosen business schools. Moreover, the authors of the present paper have explored some barriers hindering the sense of organizational inclusion among academics and subsequently classified them as cultural, functional and psychological barriers. CONCLUSION: The authors propose three prompt managerial interventions for Egyptian public business schools. The first is economic, and proposes a link be created between the financial remuneration of professors and the number of academic theses they supervise. The second is functional, and strongly recommends that units be created for managing foreign educational grants and scholarships. The third is cultural, and proposes that cultural tolerance units be required to manage any discriminatory and unequal opportunity claims. This paper contributes by filling a gap in HR management in the higher education sector, in which empirical studies on the practices of organizational inclusion have been limited so far."},

Moreover, gender has no or little effect on physicians\u2019 perceptions of workplace happiness. We also found that workplace happiness positively affects physicians\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour, and finally, diversity management practices can mediate the relationship between workplace happiness and physicians\u2019 organisational citizenship behaviour.Practical implicationsWe believe that managers can raise the feeling of workplace happiness among their staff if they maintain some personal relationships with physicians, care about the physicians\u2019 work/life balance, promote after work gatherings, initiate coffee time talks, encourage open communication practices and more.Originality/valueThe paper is based on the argument that although employees might be happy in the workplace through (engagement, job satisfaction, affective commitment), their happiness, however,will unlikely be reflected into a positive organisational citizenship behaviour towards their organisation, except (social exchange theory) they feel or perceive (equity theory) the overall practices of diversity management in that organisation positively.

A total of 80 academics from three universities were contacted and interviewed in six different focus groups. Three types of motives were identified from the interviews: extrinsic local, intrinsic school and extrinsic global, which inspired academics to believe in the importance of implementing RME in their business schools. Most respondents consider implementing RME is crucial to rebuilding their schools' legitimate and ethical role. Focusing only on academics rather than the executives of the selected business schools, is perceived to be a limitation. Moreover, addressing only public business schools and excluding private ones may limit the authors\u2019 ability to generalize results. Thus, the authors of this paper invite researchers from the fields of cultural diversity, CSR, sustainability and higher education (HE) to collaborate in producing more interdisciplinary and/or trans-disciplinary papers on the same topic. Future researchers may seek to investigate the perceptions of management in the addressed business schools. Replicating this study with private business schools in Egypt may be considered another research opportunity. The educational authorities need to develop a framework for implementing and assessing RME in public business schools. This paper contributes by filling a gap in HE management, responsible leadership, and sustainability literature in which empirical studies on RME and the responsible practices of academics have been limited so far."},

The paper adopts a system dynamics approach, to construct suitable simulation models that could be used to examine the complex and dynamic interactions between student flows, staff ratios and investments in plant and facilities. The study involved interviews with key university personnel, focus groups with university staff, a survey of student perceptions and personal observations of key departments at the university selected for the study. Further interviews were held with members of staff of all the other private universities in Syria. The simulation model developed in this study has provided insightful and meaningful exploration of data whose practical applicability is not necessarily restricted to the Syrian university, but broadly encompasses all educational sectors, whether private or public. The model designed in this research is a decision support system, one that is a flexible tool to design measures that might help to improve student enrolments.

To understand the impact of FAS on student enrollment, six statistical tests were conducted. Based on the level of FAS adopted by universities, we identified four groups of UK universities: very low, low, medium, and high levels of FAS. No robust evidence exists to support claims that universities which apply a higher level of FAS have higher student enrollment. The study results were based only on secondary data collected from HESA, so future studies should be based on other types of data.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 330 academics were contacted and given a set of questionnaires. After three follow-ups, a total of 240 responses were collected with a response rate of 72.73 percent. Multiple regressions were employed to show how much variation in organizational downsizing can be explained by inclusive/exclusive talent management and responsible leadership. Findings: The findings highlighted a very weak statistical association between academics\u2019 inclusive talent management and organizational downsizing, whereas a strong statistical association has been discovered between exclusive talent management and organizational downsizing. Statistical analysis showed that responsible leadership has no role in mediating the relationship between inclusive/exclusive talent management of academics and their downsizing. Research limitations/implications: The authors have focused on only three Egyptian public business schools, the matter that may limit opportunities to generalize the results of this study to private business schools and other faculties in Egypt. Future research could use a double source method. Practical implications: By preparing a set of academic competences, business schools will be able to classify their academic staff into talented and non-talented, and accordingly they can initiate their tailored downsizing strategies. Furthermore, undertaking a responsible strategy of downsizing, which includes and is not limited to justifying the need to decrease academic staff numbers to guarantee post-redundancy care practices for laid-off academics may alleviate many of the negative psychological, societal and economic consequences of downsizing. Originality/value: This paper contributes by filling a gap in HR management and higher education literature, in which empirical studies on the relationship between talent management and academics\u2019 organizational downsizing have been limited until now.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 960 academics were contacted and all of them received a set of questionnaires. After four follow ups, a total of 576 responses were collected with a response rate of 60.00 per cent. The author used the chi-square test to determine the association between organizational learning and authentic leadership. Multiple regressions were used to show how much variation in individual-level resistance to change can be explained by organizational learning and authentic leadership. Findings: The findings highlight a statistical association between organizational learning and authentic leadership. Moreover, another statistical association is explored between authentic leadership and individual-level resistance to change. Furthermore, the statistical analysis proved that having an authentic leadership in the workplace fosters the effect of organizational learning in alleviating individual\u2019s resistance to change. Research limitations/implications: Data were collected only from academics and did not include rectors and/or heads of academic departments, the matter that may lead to an inflation of statistical relationships. Future research could use a double source method. Moreover, focusing only on private foreign universities working in Egypt diminishes the author\u2019s potential for generalizing his results. Practical implications: The author recommends establishing a unit for knowledge management inside every university. The function of this unit includes but is not limited to examining prospective socio-political, cultural and economic changes/challenges in the surrounding environment and preparing the possible scenarios for dealing with them. This in turn should comprise involvement and learning opportunities for academics work in these universities. The suggested units should also organize monthly meetings between academics and representatives from different Egyptian sectors such as NGOs personnel, CEOs of private and public companies, environmentalists and politicians to address what change those actors seek universities to undertake to guide academics to fulfill their expectations.

Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 502 employees from six HE institutions. Two measures of organizational outcomes were selected for this study, namely, job satisfaction (JS) and OC. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), the authors tested four alternative models to indicate the relationship between leadership and organizational outcomes. Findings: TL has both direct and indirect effects on OC through interactional justice (IJ). TL has an impact on JS through procedural justice (PJ) and IJ as intermediate variables, while transactional leadership (TrL) has an impact on JS through distributive justice (DJ). The three types of OJ have an impact on OC through JS. The authors found that the national culture may not influence the impact of the leader in the current globalization context, as the results were similar to the Western studies. Practical implications: The findings of the study provide managers of the HE sector with insights into the formations of employees\u2019 fairness perceptions, and with some guidelines for managing employees by documenting OJ to draw positive attitudinal and behavioral responses from employees. Originality/value: While most previous research has focused on exploring the relationship between leadership and OJ or between OJ and JS in the business sector, the study, however, seeks in addition, to pinpoint the effect of OJ as a mediate variable between the leadership and JS and OC in HE."},

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 89 students who took the MBTI inventory in five selected faculties at Damascus University in Syria. In order to rate the subjects' like or dislike level, the students were asked to complete a form prepared for this purpose. The students' GPAs were also included in the analysis. Findings: Using paired sample t-test, the results indicate a statistically significant correlation between type of student and his/her faculty of study, type of student and overall study subject like, and type of student and his/her GPA.

Based on the model of student buyer behavior developed by Kotler and Fox in 1995, the study focuses on the first step of this model, so-called motives. The study results are based on qualitative data collected by means of semi-structured styles of interviews with 30 current students at three higher education institutions in Syria in the summer of 2010.The study reveals three dimensions of needs and motives. These are: Self needs and motives; Social needs and motives, and Souk (market) needs and motives. Accordingly, several detailed explanations for each dimension concluded from the study are presented. The findings reveal that the three dimensions are important for university students in Syria when attending universities. People responsible for marketing in higher education institutions need to pay attention to understand their students' motives when designing their customer-oriented marketing strategies. Study programs at universities could be designed to better satisfy such needs and motives. This study could provide bases for further research through a replication of the model using the information offered by the survey. Further research could investigate the research questions in a wider student population employing a quantitative approach. The importance of this study comes from the classification of needs and motives into a three-Ss model (Self, Society and Souk).

Focusing on the obstacles to developing international partnerships, the study results are developed from 24 interviews with senior and very senior university managers from four leading UK universities. The results indicate that the obstacles to international partnerships for each of the four universities in this study can be grouped into two main categories: the obstacles that are relevant to the process of partner selection, and the obstacles that are relevant to the process of partnership arrangements. The study ends up with a model of obstacles of international partnerships in universities. In terms of strategy evaluation, obstacles related to the partner (whether they are focused or diversified), and obstacles related to the partnership arrangements (whether they are also focused or diversified) identify four quadrants of strategy evaluation: Realistic strategy, Partner-reevaluation, Arrangement-reevaluation, and Unrealistic strategy. The study brings up the difficulties that come from the drivers of international partnerships and the associated problems. Accordingly, it points out from the data a classification of the obstacles confronting international partnerships and further models this classification. The study however does not tackle some related issues such as the positive side of international partnerships. In this regard, a study exploring the outcomes of international partnerships would be of great importance for researchers and for practitioners in the field. Given the necessity of revising the process of establishing international partnerships by university managers, the model resulting from this study would be of vast importance to university international office directors and other university policy makers. This study provides a new classification for obstacles confronting UK universities' international partnerships and develops an original model of these obstacles. This model is expected to be useful for both policy makers and researchers. The study is sustaining the series of studies of international partnership strategy for a group of four UK universities implemented by Ayoubi and followed by a paper in ICERI."},

A survey designed in Arabic for the purpose of the study. Factor analysis and cluster analysis are both employed in this study in order to test the proposed model and address the research questions. Companies of the study are assigned to a predetermined four groups grid using nearest centroid sorting based on Euclidean distances. Syrian businessmen and managers could be classified into two groups according to their CSR perspectives and their marketing motivations. The two groups have similar perspectives regarding CSR. The group of majority, however, does not perceive CSR marketing incentives. Moreover, the dataset suggests that marketing is a weak motivation for CSR. This suggests that most Syrian businessmen and managers do perceive CSR as a matter of ethics but do not see ways to benefit from CSR practices as a marketing tool. Companies in Syria should be more supported by the government in order to bear the short term costs of CSR practices. Managers should seek ways to meet societal needs and development. The study should have taken the corporate incentives towards CSR with regard to each stakeholder group in order to identify the power and/or importance of each of these groups from Syrian managers' perspectives. This study is reported to be the first study undertaking the perceptions of Syrian private business owners and managers towards CSR concepts and issues and examining the managers' marketing motivations for adapting CSR practices."},

Based on the student choice model, the study aims at exploring motivations, behaviour, decision-taking factors and evaluation of purchasing process for the EFL service. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a case study for one of the biggest family business providers in the EFL market in the City of Damascus, in Syria. Semi-structured styles of interviews were conducted with 30 currently registered students, in the studied centre, covering five main research questions. Findings: Consistent with the previous literature of consumer behaviour, the findings show that EFL students may go through six steps of purchasing the EFL product. Accordingly, several detailed explanations for each step of the consumer behaviour of EFL, concluded from the study, were presented. Within the consumer behaviour model, the study highlights the importance of individual self study as a phase that should be given more consideration by researchers. Research limitations/implications: This study could provide bases for further research through a replication of the model of consumer behaviour and using the information offered by the survey. Further research could investigate the research questions in a wider student population employing a more quantitative approach. Practical implications: People responsible for marketing in EFL institutes should pay more attention to understanding their customer behaviour, rather than engaging in reactive competition practices and focusing on marketing elements and promotion. Originality/value: The importance of this study comes from the lack of research into understanding the private, fee-paying EFL customer buyer behaviour in general and in the Syrian context in particular."},

Not all nations responded similarly to these effects, but for most of them, the growth and diversification in global markets and products increase the concerns and worries of the quality of educational human products. The accreditation and affiliation of international student degree turns into crucial national attempts to confront the challenges of global education. Based on the Syrian National Standard Medical Test, this paper looks at the accumulated experience in the Syrian Arab Republic, explains the country\u2019s practices in managing and assuring the quality of international medical education of returning graduates, and evaluates the national efforts paid in this context. First the paper assesses the size of the problem in Syria by providing and discussing some statistics provided by the candidates applying to the Syrian National Standard Medical Test. Then it empirically investigates the educational and other related characteristics of the candidates who failed passing the medical quality assurance procedures (including the test). The data is collected from the candidates\u2019 application records over a period of three years. The study further investigates how successful the test and the other related quality assurance procedures are on the light of the empirical test\u2019s results. The evaluation of the quality assurance procedures is done by interviewing some of the key Syrian higher education players. This study is the first academic study tackling the response of Syrian higher education sector towards globalisation concerns. The study highlights the difficulties encountered by Syrian decision maskers in a number of dimensions including the political, the ethical and the social. It also gives suggestions and recommendations to better manage the issues of higher education fraud and corruption"},

International cooperation and partnerships became as an important asset for universities, where in order to facilitate such international cooperation, selecting partners and arranging partnerships were considered as a major organizational steps towards the success of the partnership itself. In UK universities and colleges, there has been more expansion in international activities primarily represented by international partnerships. Theoretically, most models of internationalization in universities focus on internationalization as a general strategy ignoring the implementation phase of such strategy. The main aim of this study is to investigate the organizational process of international strategy in UK universities through institutional partnerships. Focusing on the \u2018mechanisms\u2019, and the \u2018obstacles\u2019 of international partnerships, the study results were based on twenty-four interviews with senior and very senior university managers from four UK leading universities. The results indicate that the mechanisms of international institutional partnerships for each university of the four universities in this study are grouped into the process of partner selecting and the process of partnership arrangements. In addition, the obstacles of international institutional partnerships are also grouped into obstacles related to the overseas partner, and obstacles related to the partnership arrangements. A comparative analysis amongst the four universities shows that all interviewees consider obstacles related to partnerships arrangements as the main obstacles in establishing overseas partnerships. The article ends up with two models of organizations and obstacles of international partnerships in universities. The two models would be of vast importance to university international office directors and researchers in the field."},

By comparing the priorities of Syrian higher education sector and the objectives of thirty three Tempus projects implemented in Syria, the study shows different levels of contribution of each project to the national priorities. An innovative concept of the National Project based on two dimensions was suggested. The two dimensions are the number of national priorities that the project meets, and the number of Syrian higher education institutions involved in each project. It is found that more than 50% of these projects meet the national priorities, and an individual project is relatively serving a few number of universities. In accordance with the concept of the national project that was proposed in this study, the results insist on the need for more national-oriented projects in the future. To guarantee the sustainability of the Programme, the study suggests that Tempus Programme should stress on developing more national-oriented projects based on the concept of the national project suggested in this study. However, from macro point of view, the results indicate that Tempus Programme could be considered as a national Programme. Empirically, this study provides decision makers of the higher education sector in Syria with relevant information regarding the intended future directions of the projects, and their contribution to the higher education development process."},

Design/methodology/approach - Both factor analysis and cluster analysis were applied on data collected from HESA (2001), and on the data collected from the mission statements of 117 universities by the use of the content analysis technique. Findings - The study shows that 74 per cent of UK universities' mission statements include international dimensions. In addition, 48 per cent of these universities are internationally active. Four groups of (international action - international mission) matrixes have been reached. These groups are \"international winners group, international actors group, international speakers group, and international losers group\". Research limitations/implications - This analysis is limited to only four variables taken in a single year 2001. Therefore, future research in this area is encouraged to employ more variables related to internationalization and to apply the analysis on longitudinal bases in order to get results that cover larger range of international aspects and allow observing the matrix development overtime. Practical implications - The study finishes with a location model which can be used as an important tool by university managers in conducting their international business. This model can also be employed in various sectors other than the higher education sector. Originality/value - The paper is the first classification carried out amongst UK universities in terms of internationalization. It is also the first of its kind in the higher education management literature in terms of both; the comprehensiveness in dealing with all the three phases of the strategy of internationalization and the nature of data it uses for this purpose."},

The analysis includes inter-university comparative analysis and templates-agreements-interviews comparative analysis for each of the four universities separately. Findings: It is found that, for the four universities, the objectives of international partnerships are related to both students and staff with relative importance given to the student dimension. While the student dimension refers to any overseas partnerships where the core topic of the partnership is the student whether it is related to student exchange, collaborative programs, student recruitment, etc.; the staff dimension refers to any overseas partnerships that are more related to the staff topic, such as joint research, collaborative teaching, staff exchange, etc. Research limitations/implications: The comparative analysis of templates-agreements- interviews show some gaps in international strategy design in one of the universities, and some gaps in international strategy implementation in the other three universities.

The processes involved in multisyllabic word reading and spelling in middle childhood are likely to differ from those in monosyllabic reading and spelling. The current paper examines the contributions of morphological awareness (MA; awareness of derivational morphemes), prosodic sensitivity (sensitivity to lexical stress), and phonological awareness (PA; awareness of phonemes) for multisyllabic word reading and spelling, after accounting for background variables (age, vocabulary, nonverbal IQ, short-term memory). Seventy 7\u201310-year-old children completed a batteryof tasks. MA and prosodic sensitivity were independent predictors of multisyllabic reading, while MA and PA were independent predictors of multisyllabic spelling. These results contrast with previous research, which instead found that PA plays a more prominent rolewhile prosodic sensitivity appears to demonstrate only an indirect influence. However,those studies largely examined reading of shorter, one to three syllable words. These findings indicate when words are longer and multisyllabic, prosodic sensitivity, PA, and MA have differing direct influences on literacy. MA and prosodic sensitivity relate to word reading, while MA and PA are important for spelling."},

This paper examines the profile of phonological and morphological awareness in poor readers and children with OM. Thirty-three poor readers were compared to individually matched chronological age and reading age controls. Their phonological awareness and morphological awareness skills were consistently at the level of reading age matched controls. Unexpectedly, a significant minority (25%) of the poor readers had some degree of undiagnosed mild or very mild hearing loss. Twenty-nine children with a history of OM and their matched controls completed the same battery of tasks. They showed relatively small delays in their literacy and showed no impairment in morphological awareness but had phonological awareness scores below the level of reading age matchedcontrols. Further analysis suggested that this weakness in phonological awareness was carried by a specific weakness in segmenting and blending phonemes, with relatively good performance on phoneme manipulation tasks. Results suggest that children with OM show a circumscribed deficit in phoneme segmentation and blending, while poor readers show a broader metalinguistic impairment which is more closely associated with reading difficulties.Publisher Statement: This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."},

All errors increased looking time but the nature of the error and participant group influenced the time course of the effects. The pseudo-homophone effect was significant in all eye-movement measures for adults (N=26), intermediate (N=37) and novice typically developing readers (N=38). This effect was larger for intermediate readers than other groups in total duration. In contrast, morphological over-regularisations increased gaze and total duration (but not first fixation) for intermediate and novice readers, and only total duration for adult readers. Syntactic errors only increased total duration. Children with dyslexia (N=19) demonstrated smaller effects of pseudo-homophones and over-regularisations than controls, but their processing of syntactic errors was similar. We conclude that dyslexic children\u2019s difficulties with reading are linked to overreliance on phonological decoding and underspecified morphological processing, which impacts on word level reading.

However, the role of motivational factors such as self-efficacy in reading progress is less clear. In particular, it is not clear how self-efficacy relates to word level reading versus comprehension, and whether this differs in boys and girls. This study examines the relationship between self-efficacy, word reading and reading comprehension across the range of reading abilities after controlling for reading-related cognitive factors. One hundred and seventy nine children (86 males and 93 females) between 8 and 11 years old completed a self-report measure of reading self-efficacy together with measures of reading comprehension and word reading, working memory, auditory short-term memory, phonological awareness, and vocabulary. Boys and girls showed similar levels of attainment and reading self-efficacy. Reading self-efficacy was associated with word reading, but not with reading comprehension in either boys or girls. It is argued that this may reflect important differences between reading self-efficacy and more general measures of reading motivation and engagement. Reading self-efficacy is an element of reading motivation that is closely associated with a child\u2019s perceived attainments in reading and is less susceptible to the gender differences seen in broader measures.\n\n"},

Intermediate and advanced readers (reading ages 9;1-12;9) perform more poorly when there is more linguistic overlap. Novice readers (reading ages 5;7-8;0) were influenced only by orthographic overlap and not by semantics, indicating that use of orthographic processes typically precedes integration of semantic and morphological skills. Children with Otitis Media (repeated ear infections) had phonological awareness difficulties but performed age appropriately on the probe detection task indicating that morphological processing is not constrained by phonology.

For example, such a relationship provides support for the orthographic influence hypothesis, and implies an effect of reading remediation on phonological abilities. However, while there is a large body of evidence showing that phonological awareness predicts reading, there is little extant research showing a convincing effect in the opposite direction. Talks 1 (Cunningham) and 2 (Malkova) present evidence that a bi-directional relationship exists between letter-knowledge and phonemic awareness in Kindergarten. Cunningham through structural equation models based on a large sample of British Kindergartners, and Malkova through an intervention study with Czech pre-schoolers. Talks 3 (Carroll) and 4 (Kolinsky) present evidence that a reciprocal relationship extends to the middle school years and adulthood. Carroll presents data from school children with phonological deficits, showing mutual predictive effects between phonological awareness and word reading accuracy. Finally, Kolinsky presents an intervention study showing that Portuguese adults who acquire literacy experience associated improvements in phonological skills. Talk 5, the Discussion (Cunningham) combines evidence from the four talks and compares with existing research to arrive at novel conclusions about the nature of reciprocity between literacy and phonological skills."},

However, additional auditory, visual and motor difficulties have also been observed in dyslexic children. It is examined to what extent these difficulties can be used to predict later literacy difficulties.\n\nMethod\nAn unselected sample of 267 children at school entry completed a wide battery of tasks associated with dyslexia. Their reading was tested 2, 3 and 4 years later and poor readers were identified (n = 42). Logistic regression and multiple case study approaches were used to examine the predictive validity of different tasks.\n\nResults\nAs expected, print knowledge, verbal short-term memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming were good predictors of later poor reading. Deficits in visual search and in auditory processing were also present in a large minority of the poor readers. Almost all poor readers showed deficits in at least one area at school entry, but there was no single deficit that characterised the majority of poor readers.\n\nConclusions\nResults are in line with Pennington's (2006) multiple deficits view of dyslexia. They indicate that the causes of poor reading outcome are multiple, interacting and probabilistic, rather than deterministic.\n\n"},

Their literacy skills were assessed at the start of formal reading instruction (age 5\u00bd), using measures of phoneme awareness, word-level reading, and spelling; and three years later (age 8), using measures of word-level reading, spelling and reading comprehension. \nResults: The presence of early SSD conferred a small but significant risk of poor phonemic skills at age 5\u00bd and of poor word reading at age 8. Furthermore, within the group with SSD, the persistence of speech difficulties to the point of school-entry was associated with poorer literacy-related skills, and children with \u2018disordered\u2019 speech errors had poorer word reading skills than children whose speech errors indicated \u2018delay\u2019. In contrast, the initial severity of the SSD was not a significant predictor of reading development. Beyond the domain of speech, the presence of a co-occurring language impairment was strongly predictive of literacy skills and having a family-risk of dyslexia predicted additional variance in literacy at both time-points. \nConclusion: Early SSD alone has only modest effects on literacy development but when additional risk factors are present these can have serious negative consequences, consistent with the view that multiple risks accumulate to predict reading disorders.\n\n"},

For a new word, this is an effortful process where each grapheme must be translated individually (serial decoding). The role of phonological awareness in developing a decoding strategy is well known. We examined whether beginning readers recruit different skills depending on the nature of the words being read (familiar words vs. nonwords). Print knowledge, phoneme and rhyme awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN), phonological short-term memory (STM), nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, auditory skills, and visual attention were measured in 392 prereaders 4 and 5. years of age. Word and nonword reading were measured 9. months later. We used structural equation modeling to examine the skills-reading relationship and modeled correlations between our two reading outcomes and among all prereading skills. We found that a broad range of skills were associated with reading outcomes: early print knowledge, phonological STM, phoneme awareness and RAN. Whereas all of these skills were directly predictive of nonword reading, early print knowledge was the only direct predictor of word reading. Our findings suggest that beginning readers draw most heavily on their existing print knowledge to read familiar words."},

Some researchers suggest that they represent words using phonetic features rather than phonemes. In this study, the authors examined whether there is a progression from feature-based to phoneme-based processing across age groups and whether responses are consistent across tasks and stimuli. Method: In Study 1, 120 three- to five-year-old children completed 3 tasks assessing use of phonetic features in classification, with an additional 58 older children completing 1 of the 3 tasks. In Study 2, all of the children, together with an additional adult sample, completed a nonword learning task. Results: In all 4 tasks, children classified words sharing phonemes as similar. In addition, children regarded words as similar if they shared manner of articulation, particularly word finally. Adults also showed this sensitivity to manner, but across the tasks, there was a pattern of increasing use of phonemic information with age. Conclusions: Children tend to classify words as similar if they share phonemes or if they share manner of articulation word finally. Use of phonemic information becomes more common with age."},

Aims.Steiner-educated children begin learning how to read at age 7, and have better reading-related skills at the onset of instruction. Therefore, it is hypothesized that older Steiner-educated children will make faster progress in early literacy than younger standard-educated controls. Samples.A total of 30 Steiner-educated children (age 7-9) were compared to a matched group of 31 standard-educated controls (age 4-6). Method.Children were tested for reading, spelling, phonological awareness, and letter knowledge at three time points during their first year of formal reading instruction and again at the end of the second year. Results.There were no significant differences between groups in word reading at the end of the first and second year or reading comprehension at the end of the second year; however, the standard group outperformed the Steiner group on spelling at the end of both years. The Steiner group maintained an overall lead in phonological skills while letter knowledge was similar in both groups. Conclusions.The younger children showed similar, and in some cases, better progress in literacy than the older children; this was attributed to more consistent and high-quality synthetic phonics instruction as is administered in standard schools. Consequently, concerns that 4- to 5-year-olds are 'too young' to begin formal reading instruction may be unfounded."},

Methods: Following screening of 960 children, 152 children (mean age 4;09) were selected from 19 schools on the basis of poor vocabulary and verbal reasoning skills and randomly allocated to either the P + R programme or the OL programme. Both groups of children received 20 weeks of daily intervention alternating between small group and individual sessions, delivered by trained teaching assistants. Children in the P + R group received training in letter-sound knowledge, phonological awareness and book level reading skills. Children in the OL group received instruction in vocabulary, comprehension, inference generation and narrative skills. The children's progress was monitored at four time points: pre-, mid- and post-intervention, and after a 5-month delay, using measures of literacy, language and phonological awareness. Results: The data are clustered (children within schools) and robust confidence intervals are reported. At the end of the 20-week intervention programme, children in the P + R group showed an advantage over the OL group on literacy and phonological measures, while children in the OL group showed an advantage over the P + R group on measures of vocabulary and grammatical skills. These gains were maintained over a 5-month period. Conclusions: Intervention programmes designed to develop oral language skills can be delivered successfully by trained teaching assistants to children at school entry. Training using P + R fostered decoding ability whereas the OL programme improved vocabulary and grammatical skills that are foundations for reading comprehension. However, at the end of the intervention, more than 50% of at-risk children remain in need of literacy support."},

Methods: Fifty young people with a family history of dyslexia and 20 young people from control families were assessed at 12-13years on a battery of tests of literacy and language skills, and they completed questionnaires tapping self-perception and print exposure. One parent from each family participated in an interview documenting family circumstances (including family literacy) and a range of environmental variables considered likely correlates of reading disability. They also rated their child's behavioural and emotional adjustment and their own health and well-being. Parental literacy levels were also measured. Results: Forty-two per cent of the 'at-risk' sample had reading and spelling impairments. A significant proportion of the literacy-impaired group were affected by behavioural and emotional difficulties, although they were not low in terms of global self-esteem. The children in the at-risk subgroup who did not fulfil criteria for literacy impairment showed weak orthographic skills in adolescence and their reading was not fluent. There were no differences in the literacy levels or activities of the parents of impaired and unimpaired at-risk children, and no significant correlation between parent and child reading levels in the at-risk group. The impaired group read less than the other groups, their reading difficulties impacted learning at school and there was evidence that they also had an impact on family life and maternal well-being. Conclusions: The literacy difficulties of children at family-risk of dyslexia were longstanding and there was no evidence of catch-up in these skills between 8 and 13years. The findings point to the role of gene-environment correlation in the determination of dyslexia."},

It has long been hypothesized that children with learning disabilities, including dyslexia, may be highly vulnerable to emotional consequences such as anxiety. However, research has centred on school-aged children. Aims. The present study aimed to clarify these findings with dyslexic students in higher education. Samples. Sixteen students with dyslexia were compared with 16 students with no history of learning difficulties. Methods. Students were asked to complete a written questionnaire concerning trait anxiety levels. They were then told that they would be given a timed reading test and their state anxiety levels were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1983). Finally, their reading was assessed using the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE; Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1999). Results. Dyslexic students showed slower reading speeds than controls. They also had higher levels of state anxiety and elevated levels of academic and social, but not appearance, anxiety. Conclusions. Dyslexic students in higher education show anxiety levels that are well above what is shown by students without learning difficulties. This anxiety is not limited to academic tasks but extends to many social situations. It is proposed that assessment of emotional well-being should form part of the assessment of need for dyslexic students entering higher education."},

Methods: A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group ( N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results: The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusions: A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school. However, around one-quarter of the children did not respond to this intervention and these children would appear to need more intensive or more prolonged help to improve their reading skills."},

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies confirm the substantial overlap of literacy problems with a range of emotional/behavioural difficulties in childhood. Literacy problems and inattention may share genetic influences, contributing to associations with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. To an extent, links with conduct problems may be also mediated by attentional difficulties. In addition, findings suggest bidirectional influences whereby disruptive behaviours impede reading progress and reading failure exacerbates risk for behaviour problems. Associations between literacy problems and anxiety disorders are not entirely mediated by inattentiveness. Rather, comorbid anxiety disorders seem likely to arise from the stressors associated with reading failure. Findings in relation to depression are less consistent, but suggest that poor readers may be vulnerable to low mood. Children with autism seem more likely to face problems in reading comprehension than the decoding difficulties more prominent in other disorders. SUMMARY: Literacy problems are associated with increased risks of both externalizing and internalizing disorders in childhood, with different mechanisms likely to be implicated in each case. When comorbid problems occur, each is likely to require separate treatment."},

Method: Relationships between specific literacy difficulties and psychiatric disorder were investigated in a large-scale national sample of children aged 9 to 15 years. Results: Specific literacy difficulties were more common in children from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and were significantly associated with increased risks of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (especially inattentive symptomatology), Conduct Disorder and anxiety disorders in both girls and boys, and with self-reports of depressed mood in boys. Associations between literacy difficulties and diagnoses of both Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) were mediated by inattentiveness, as were links with low mood. Links between specific literacy difficulties and anxiety were of a different nature, suggestive of a direct impact of literacy problems on risk for anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Literacy difficulties are significantly associated with externalising disorders via inattention, but may constitute a more immediate risk factor for naturally anxious children to develop clinically significant levels of anxiety."},

This article aims to elucidate this relationship by considering the links between letter knowledge and two sub-skills of phoneme awareness: phoneme segmentation and phoneme invariance. Two studies are reported. The first study consisted of an eight-month longitudinal study with 56 pre-literate children. No child within this group was successful on any phoneme awareness task unless they knew at least one letter. Letter knowledge was also a significant predictor of later phoneme completion and deletion. The hypothesis that letter knowledge is an important precursor for phoneme awareness was then investigated in a small-scale intervention study with ten children. These children were taught letters and their phoneme awareness was monitored. It was found that letter knowledge was specifically related to the development of phoneme segmentation in pre-literate children. Possible reasons for this finding are discussed."},

Objectives: To summarize the history of research on sex differences in reading disability and to provide new evidence from 4 independent epidemiological studies about the nature, extent, and significance of sex differences in reading disability. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study comprised 989 individuals (52.1% male) in a cohort born between April 1972 and March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, and followed up from age 3 years; reading performance and IQ were assessed at ages 7, 9, and 11 years using the Burt Word Reading Test and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), respectively. The Christchurch Health and Development Study comprised 895 individuals (50% male) in a prospectively studied cohort born in the Christchurch, New Zealand, region during a 4-month period in 1977; reading performance and IQ were assessed at ages 8 to 10 years using the Burt Word Reading Test and the WISC-R. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) Study comprised a UK nationally representative sample of 5752 children (50.1% male) aged 9 to 15 years in 1999; reading was assessed on the British Ability Scales II and IQ on the British Picture Vocabulary Scales II. The Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (E-Risk) comprised 2163 twin children from England and Wales (49.1% male) identified at birth in 1994 and 1995 and included administration of the Test of Word Reading Efficiency at age 7 years and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised as a test of IQ at age 5 years. Main Outcome Measure: Reading performance by sex in the lowest 15% of the distribution for all 4 studies, with and without taking IQ into account. Results: In all 4 studies, the rates of reading disability were significanfly higher in boys. For non-IQ-referenced reading disability: Dunedin study, 21.6% in boys vs 7.9% in girls (odds ratio [OR], 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.15-4.17); Christchurch study, 20.6% in boys vs 9.8% in girls (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.62-3.50); ONS study, 17.6% in boys vs 13.0% in girls (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.23-1.65); and E-Risk, 18.0% in boys vs 13.0% in girls (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.86). The rates for IQ-referenced reading disabilities were similar. Conclusion: Reading disabilities are clearly more frequent in boys than in girls."},

The lack of tactile assets was also a problem as the archive mainly consisted of notebooks, blueprints, drawings and photographs. The research aim was to create and enact a communication model (the Processual Model of Digital Amplification or PMDA) exploiting the visual elements of the archive through Xtended (augmented and virtual) reality, thus facilitating community engagement and increasing the reach of this heritage.The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) granted the researcher \u00a3466,000 to create the Lanchester Interactive Archive (LIA) to tell the story of Lanchester born in 1868, one of the greatest polymaths of the UK who invented amongst many other things; the first all British petrol motor car; wrote the scientific fundamentals of flight and patented over 400 inventions. The archive was the inspiration for augmented and virtual reality assets and games that explain the physics behind his inventions. A physical/digital micro museum open to the public was designed alongside a physical pop-up version of a Lanchester car, in blueprint design, to take Lanchester\u2019s heritage out to the community.Public engagement was measured by audience comments and attendance at public events in an independent report for the HLF. The positive results of the research were established through focus groups, surveys and interviews. The LIA is used for scholarship in many disciplines including two PhD studies. The communication model developed during the project is now used in UK, Egypt, Morocco, Austria, Germany, Sweden and Portugal, however the longer-term impact of the LIA derives from the stimulation of discourse about the role of technology and pop-up xtended reality cultural exhibitions in the community. Supporting Statement The public engagement with this archive has increased from less than 10 people a year to over 25,000 people physically visiting the LIA micro museum and pop-up since it opened in 2017. The innovation in this project is threefold, revolving around the development of an original conceptual framework for heritage and education (the PMDA); the use of xtended reality to tell the narrative; and a flexible mobile, blueprint-styled pop-up exhibition to increase access. The research underpinning the development of the LIA aimed to increase understanding of how best to engage local communities with, and to enhance knowledge of; the archive of Frederick Lanchester. Significant engagement with the archive included over 50 local community workshops and over 30 school visits using the resources to engage communities and increase knowledge of the LIA inventions through innovative digital assets. The LIA was disseminated at many conferences including New York, Revolutionary Learning, The Museums Association Conference, Birmingham and the MUSE Conference, Chile. Several broadcasting items including a BBC TV News item have disseminated the LIA to many thousands of people.Scholarly impact includes: third year engineering students researching Lanchester\u2019s now digitised patents as source material; marketing students research the archive and exhibition in order to develop marketing plans; development of the LIA added to the curriculum for product design resulting in students designing their own pop-up Lanchester model. Through research of the now digitised archive a student discovered one of Lanchester\u2019s inventions that would have pre-dated the Wright brothers\u2019 invention of the first flying machine, achieving a prize from the Aeronautical Society and is using the LIA as the source for his PhD. Eight Universities from Egypt and Morocco are now using the LIA and PMDA model in their own scholarship, plus it is the basis for an EU Erasmus Plus project ViRAL where less advantaged citizens are taught research and archiving skills."},

Using the DIY installation as the key we enabled otherwise marginalised communities to engage with historical and political content in digital form through their own traditional and disruptive media curation, adapting the installation to new contexts and locations. The project was disseminated globally, the DIY installation toured across the UK, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Italy and South Africa. The cell was re-created in a wide variety of venues from Brussels City Hall and the Mandela Museum to libraries in Sweden and sports halls in the Townships in South Africa. At the end of the project it was visited by over 170,000 people across six countries at thirty-seven venues with nineteen of those venues in South Africa.Supporting Statement Research on Robben Island into the life of Nelson Mandela and the informal learning adopted at Robben Island Prison by the political prisoners during the struggle to end apartheid greatly influenced the team and was translated into the installation. The research questions were framed around: access to heritage through DIY flexible hackable spaces; the ability to create meaning by selecting objects, both physical and digital, from the project resources in order to re-create the history of political struggles; and how this allowed the installation to exist as a cultural space of debate both within and outside the institution.  Any relatively recent national political struggle can be a touchstone for anger and high emotions, Apartheid, however, is a particularly sensitive and emotive subject to discuss with communities in South Africa. The team therefore had to find a way to present the information and allow Mandela27 to provoke discourse, discussion and examination of the past using the physical and digital objects within the installation.We showed that it is possible to take digital archives and museum collections out into the real world, to transpose them into culturally sensitive and context specific pop-up environments, which become more accessible to local communities. This socio-cultural learning not only increased the knowledge of the community about their heritage but increased their resonance and influence. This gave rise to the possibility that  'hacking the museum' is a more democratic and suitable way of presenting cultural history in a postdigital era.Mandela27 succeeded in changing attitudes to equality and racial prejudice through school and college installations facilitated by: instructions on how to build your own Mandela27 pop-up cell; a digital platform, plus posters and teacher notes. It was disseminated widely with over 70 press and broadcast articles engaging the public. Impact was created when the Mandela27 physical/digital model was replicated in the Photomediations Flatpack Exhibition (Shaw, 2016), and in the Disruptive Media Learning Lab Busted  mobile lab. Mandela27 was also the inspiration for the EU project Grandmas Story which used the concept of flexible pop up exhibitions to tell the stories of migrant families across the EU. "},

In the current study, we tested the impact of (EI) on (LE) and the moderating role of gender on this relationship. We employed Hierarchical Moderated Multiple Regression analysis (MMR) for our data, which we collected from 141 questionnaires using a non-probabilistic technique from Fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) in Egypt. We found that EI is positively related to LE. The gender variable moderated both the relationship between others\u2019 emotional appraisal and LE and use of emotion and LE. Specifically, others\u2019 emotional appraisal was positively associated with LE for females, but almost unrelated for males; whereas the positive relationship between use of emotion and LE was stronger for males compared to females. The current study highlights the crucial role that human resource development and training would play in augmenting EI skills for both female and male leaders in general, and how each gender needs to better develop understanding on the other gender emotional positions. Our data was collected from a small sample of only two organizations, which hinders our ability in generalizing the findings to other organizations. While conducting future research, these aspects should be kept in mind, which can provide more valuable results. Conducting this study in Egypt contributes to the international learning experience on EI and LE in countries other than Western ones."},

International comparisons showed that mathematics was a subject in which there was much room for improvement. As it is now ten years since the introduction of the new curriculum, it is time to review its implementation. A key element of the 2013 curriculum is using the Scientific Approach (observing, asking, exploring, associating, and communicating) as the fundamental pedagogy with a general emphasis on active learning. This study explores the extent to which this has been implemented within the classroom by utilizing various data sources, including student focus group discussions, classroom observations, documentation reviews and teacher interviews. This produced a multi-dimensional data set which reveals that ten years on from its introduction, the implementation of the Scientific approach in mathematics is, at best, inconsistent. In practice, there is still a great reliance on teacher-centered pedagogies, although lesson plans indicate an intent to promote more active learning. Students tend to remain passive and individual learners, although they express a strong desire to work together. Teachers report difficulties in finding appropriate learning media to facilitate active learning pedagogies and school infrastructures are often a hindrance to the use of the Scientific Approach."},

The English school system couples organisational autonomy with close scrutiny of educational outcomes. The management of the performance of headteachers is a central aspect of such a system. The research involved a systematic literature review and the collection of data via national surveys, expert interviews and case studies. The findings point to three overarching conditions essential for what we identify as 'performance leadership': relational trust between the head-teacher and the governing body; situational awareness by the governing body of the school's circumstances and the headteacher's lived experience of the role; and a systems perspective shared by the headteacher and governing body of performance management as one aspect of a comprehensive, interactive system of internal accountability, not merely an annual rite of passage. The study found that capacity in any two conditions offers a foundation for developing capability in the third. It also revealed the dominant role played by middle-tier structures in defining what constitutes 'effective' performance for any school or group of schools. The article offers insight into the changing landscape of performance expectations, for school leaders as well as for those who oversee their work."},

School leaders are crucially important for the effective functioning of schools and there is an ever-growing body of inspection and research evidence which shows this to be the case \u2013 leadership matters, in particular principal or headteacher leadership. Oversight of the performance of school leaders is therefore crucial in the English educational system due to current initiatives promoting school autonomy coupled with tight, centralised accountability. Researchers in other countries have noted the lack of systematic understanding of the performance management of senior school leaders. The same applies to England; however, current changes to the educational system, including increased school autonomy and the centrality of school improvement, linked to inspection, make the stakes much higher than elsewhere. Understanding HTPM, especially the role of the external adviser or school improvement partner, is crucial given the evolving structure of the educational system and the shifting relationship between the state and schools. The role of the external adviser is especially pronounced in helping the governing body set objectives for its headteacher and make decisions about remuneration and salary increases. The article considers the degree to which outside assistance enables governing bodies to complete their key role in relation to managing the performance of headteachers and it outlines the main constraints under which external assistance and support operates. The article considers the role of external advisers as critical friends and concludes that good governing is at the heart of effective HTPM; the two are complementary. Governing bodies and boards of trustees will play a key role in the future, a role which can be made easier with the help of effective external advisers."},

The potential for fragmentation is considerable with diversity of governance emerging as a key feature of the new schooling landscape. Consequently, a major and widely recognised issue to which these reforms give rise concerns the future of the middle tier -that layer between individual schools or groups of schools and central government. There are competing visions of how a future middle tier might evolve: one focuses entirely on a middle tier of individual schools and chains as a self-improving system; others conceive a continuing but revised role for the local authority (LA). The aim of this paper is to begin to explore the latter position, and in particular the potential role of the LA as a broker of new patterns of school organisation. Drawing on interview data from three very different LA areas, the findings show that LAs differ in how they conceive their role and, consequently, on the strategies that they pursue."},

This was symptomatic of a long-standing difference in status between the two phases. At a time when relations between stakeholders in local systems are subject to change, we seek to understand anew why that might be the case and how the tension we found was evidence of a current difference of power within interactions between representatives of the phases. We analyse differences of size, resources, workforce, pedagogy and history, and how they have resulted in different, and differently valued, practices and professional identities. We explore how attributes of the two phases have been counterposed and how, in complex interaction with wider discourses of politics, gender and age, this process has invested the differences with meanings and values that tend to relegate attributes associated with primary school. By focusing on the activation of cumulative inequality in interactions, we contribute a complementary perspective to studies of perceived relative status and highlight the implications for understanding school positioning in local arenas as the role of local authorities is reduced."},

The article analyses interviews in three LAs with 15 headteachers whose schools were well positioned locally. We sought to understand how and why they responded to the changing policy environment. We applied Bourdieu's concepts of forms of capital to model the relationships between schools and to ground explanations of their responses as positioning themselves in the local field. The article develops this general approach by identifying the varieties of capital available and actually possessed. The most important was categorization as a result of the inspection process. Many of the headteachers felt impelled to lead their schools into various associations with other schools. Some individuals were becoming notably more powerful in their competition arenas. The power of these elite schools to further accumulate advantage and the withdrawal of the LA role as an arbiter of conflict between schools in the interests of the whole community are discussed."},

This seminar was influential to me in the way that I approached my own teaching in primary schools. Much later on, in the 1990s, and working in the area of leadership and management, I came across the name Alec Clegg, the Chief Education Officer of the West Riding, in terms of how he worked as a leader and manager. I noted that he was a man of many pithy comments, who brought humour to management, a quality that I appreciated. I also made the connection back to Mrs Pyrah, and began to see her work as rooted in the ethos that Alec Clegg generated in the West Riding.

It is not enough for a leader to acknowledge the inherent emotions in the culture of an organization; s/he has to make them explicit through their own leadership.

Drawing on research, this article outlines the role of the external adviser in headteacher appraisal and what we know about how it is working in practice. Some of the key issues are explored and questions raised for further research. External advisers were very clear that their primary role was as advisers and supporters to the governors, but they also put considerable emphasis on the support that they provided for headteachers. They understood, however, that the ultimate responsibility for the performance management of the head lay with the governing body. They also saw themselves as counsellors, facilitators, mentors, honest brokers, coaches and governor trainers. The key to their role was the fact that they were outsiders, with no axe to grind and with no connection to either the LEA or to the national inspection agency (OfSTED)."},

The issue is investigated through case studies of nine primary schools, deemed by OfSTED to be educationally effective and efficient. The external pressures on schools to adopt a technicist-rational approach to management have been intensified by application of the OfSTED inspection guidelines. The school development plan and its implementation now form a crucial part of the evidence which inspectors use to judge the management and efficiency of the school. Schools that are deemed educationally effective and efficient by OfSTED inspectors may therefore be expected to show high levels of technicist-rational planning.

Consideration of the basis for judgements made also shows that there is some inconsistency in the application of criteria by inspectors especially in matters of resource management.

Focusing on the Nordic countries, the paper studies parallel processes of intra-Nordic and European HE and research cooperation. Although individual Nordic countries opt for different kinds of relationships with the European Union (EU), they have participated in the Europeanisation process of HE and research while intensifying their Nordic regional identity. Drawing on spatial logics in European integration and HE regionalism theories, the concept of \u2018Nordic added value\u2019 (NAV) and three Nordic flagship programmes, this paper addresses two questions: What are the links and outcomes of parallel regionalising processes of the EU-Nordic and intra-Nordic cooperation in HE and research?

We will focus on the programme\u2019s embedded mechanisms for training, development, and practice-sharing amongst the cohort of supervisors from across the three institutions. We will briefly share how an international cohort of doctoral candidates was recruited for the dual award programme in order to meet the funders\u2019 profiling and equity targets and explain how the research programme itself is addressing complex challenges in contemporary higher education in South Africa and the UK.  The aim of the discussion is to centre our ideas around doctorate supervision of fellow academics in virtual Borderland spaces (Billot et al., 2021). The use of \u201cborder\u201d not only referring to geo-political borders across our education landscapes, but also the territorial borders linked to research knowledge versus indigenous and societal knowledge (Le Grange, 2012; Mignolo & Tlostanova, 2006).

These unintended outcomes constitute the vulnerability, disengagement or superficial conformity to regional agreements of newer member countries. The chapter asks what causes unintended outcomes in the regional processes and why the peripheral status of newer members continues to persist to the detriment of regional integration. Drawing on empirical data of national higher education reforms in newer members and comparing regional projects in Asia and Europe, the author argues that the dysfunction and transformation of nation-states and weak governance structures can be seen as causes of these unintended outcomes.Furthermore, new sub-regional economic projects and influx of multiple international influences also cause fa\u00e7ade conformity and complex reconfigurations of higher education systems in the newer members.

The initial aims were security and trade. Recently, however, higher education has been brought into these regionalising processes, largely as a response to the globalising of neoliberalism. The paper argues that regions are social, economic, and political constructions shaped by both material forces and cultural factors. It emphasises the importance of the latter and explains three mechanisms at work: harmonisation to build intra-ASEAN higher education cooperation; socialisation to create the ASEAN+3 region; and mutual learning to engage with the EU in shaping an \u2018ASEM Education Area\u2019. These mechanisms influence the ways in which regional actors form new conceptions of self and other, negotiate norms, and (re)construct their identities and interests, thus creating new forms of cooperation and community. Particularly, mutual learning generates the outcome of a deeper negotiation for an equal partnership between the \u2018Asia\u2019 and the \u2018Europe\u2019 in ASEM. Hence, higher education regionalism emerges as a way to reposition Southeast Asia."},

The main thrust of this chapter is to bring these two into conversation with each other through examining how a region and sector relate to each other in terms of the consequences of sectoral cooperation for the region, on the one hand, and of regional cooperation on the sector, on the other. My entry point is the construction of a new \u2018regional sectoral space\u2019 between Asia and Europe, designated as an Asia\u2013Europe Meeting (ASEM) Education Area by the ASEM Ministers of Education in 2011. In particular, the chapter seeks answers to the following questions: How and through what process has the ASEM education process emerged as a region-building project? How and why was higher education made a key priority on the ASEM education agenda? Three aspects to this distinctive regionalizing process will be developed in this chapter. The first is that the ASEM Education Area is a hybrid in that it develops traits from novel combinations of the Bologna Process, on the one hand, and Asian experiences on the other, through its regional educational cooperation activities. The second is that it is sectoral. That is, it refers to those processes in the higher education sector which are distinct from, and thus different to, ASEM cooperation in other sectors (such as trade, public health, environment, transport or security). The third, regionalism from within, is used to explain the distinct features of the ASEM education process that have been shaped by the national interests of member countries and the inter-subjective knowledge which has emerged from within the community of actors who are endogenous to the higher education sector."},

This paper draws on policy diffusion approach in regional studies literature and a constructivist approach to policy movement and mutation in geography to examine how Bologna policies have travelled to ASEAN and transformed their features and effects in the new context. Bringing the theoretical frameworks from political science and geography into higher education studies, this paper attempts to make a novel methodological contribution. Tracing the evolution of the ASEAN regional cooperation in higher education over the last four decades and using first-hand empirical data, this paper argues that although the Bologna Process provides a point of reference for ASEAN, the active construction of an ASEAN regional higher education space in its flexible institutional design can become a model in its own right and potentially provide a useful source for reflecting on European Bologna practices."},

Over the last decade the European Union (EU) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been making more attempts to shape this route by creating an educational partnership through an inter-regional forum for regional cooperation and policy development: the Asia\u2013Europe Meeting (ASEM). Beside economic and diplomatic relations, education has been receiving increasing attention since the 2000s and has become an important and strategic act of cooperation by ASEM education ministers. Higher education and lifelong learning are the main topics for the multi-level dialogues and exchanges of ideas between the two regions. This paper describes the emergence of this new inter-regional educational phenomenon and examines its characteristics by analysing the case of the 10-year-old ASEM Lifelong Learning Initiative. Furthermore, the paper argues that ASEM education cooperation carries characteristics of a cultural and associational process, an agenda-setting process, a policy transfer process, an instrument for intra-regional integration and building regional identity."},

Detailed plans for 2020 were discussed including a series of site visits and face-to-face training. However, the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the plans in ways that could not have been foreseen and new ways of thinking and doing came to the fore. Writing from an insider perspective as project partners, in this paper we draw from appreciative inquiry, using a metaphor of a mosaic as our identity, to first provide the background on the iKudu project before sharing the impact of the pandemic on the project\u2019s adapted approach. We then discuss how alongside the focus of iKudu in the delivery of an internationalised and transformed curriculum using COIL, we have, by our very approach as project partners, adopted the principles of COIL exchange. A positive impact of the pandemic was that COIL offered a consciousness raising activity, which we suggest could be used more broadly in order to help academics think about international research practice partnerships, and, as in our situation, how internationalised and decolonised curriculum practices might be approached."},

Using both surveys (328) and follow-up interviews (40) from students at two Anglo-Sino programmes, this study explores students\u2019 perceptions and experiences of teaching and learning in TNHE in China. Drawing on the five components of the intercultural dialogue framework, this paper reveals that Chinese students\u2019 experience of teaching was fragmented not least through a mixture of cultural approaches to pedagogy including a teacher-centred approach by the local Chinese teachers and a student-centred approach by the foreign teachers, with the latter generally preferred by the students. The findings yield several important implications for contextualized curriculum and careful consideration of the TNHE learning environment in China."},

This trend can be considered in relation to several issues. For example, universities are experiencing an increase in their recruitment of international students (Beech 2018; Borjesson, 2017; Fliegler, 2014); online international learning is increasingly becoming a core pillar of university collaborations for globally networked learning (Villar-Onrubia & Rajpal, 2016; Redden, 2014; Bell, 2016); and open courses such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) target learners, regardless of their geographic and cultural background (Maringe & Sing, 2014; Brahimi & Sarirete, 2015; Affouneh, Wimpenny, Ra\u2019Fat Ghodieh et al., 2018). \nIn countries like Jordan that, due to their demographic and socioeconomic context, are experiencing a massification phenomenon with respect to learners accessing higher education (HE), responsive, effective education processes are required to maintain quality learning experiences (Affouneh & Amin Awad Raba 2017; Foley & Massingila, 2014; Dian-Fu & Yeh, 2012).\nThis paper presents the activities and the findings of ongoing the JOVITAL project in its goal of building the capacity of Jordanian educational technologies. \nJOVITAL is an international cooperation project co-funded by the Erasmus + Capacity Building in HE programmes of the European Union during the period October 2017 - 2020 involving four European institutions and five Jordanian universities. The aim of JOVITAL is to foster academic exchange using virtual mobility in order to offer learning opportunities to academic staff, university students and disadvantaged learners in Jordan.\n"},

Our paper outlines how new and emerging technologies are being innovatively used in institutions around the world and on this basis, how they are being adapted and implemented in Jordan as part of JOVITAL. Regulations and instructions on an institutional and national level have been continuously changing over the years, with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) approving the blended model within 25% of programmes, placing a cap on the amount of online learning that take place within a HE programme. However, an alliance of three or more Jordanian universities can establish a fully online programme as well. That being said, MOHESR has expressed some constraints regarding quality assurance including the way exams are conducted, how learning outcomes are measured and how course funding and cultural perceptions are considered. Challenges in the open education methodology, therefore, still exist in the academic medium in Jordan, where three main issues are of particular note: The governmental policies instructed by Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; the alignment of these policies with regulations published by Jordanian accreditation institutes; and the cultural acceptability of open education and distance learning in general. The ideas we present here include applications of technology for domestic online learning, as well as global partnerships that support the development of intercultural competencies through the use of Virtual Collaborative Learning (VCL) or Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL). This paper presents the activities and the findings of our project work to date and provides a snapshot of the JOVITAL project during its delivery."},

In the UK, almost all higher education institutions offer some kind of IGC experience to students, whether through classroom interactions, specialist courses or through placement and exchange schemes or years abroad. Before examining the link to attainment, it is useful to begin by defining IGC, which is a multi-faceted concept. The internationalization of curriculum content is defined as seeking to foster globally outward-looking student behaviours. Coventry University's latest corporate plan shows the aspiration of being a dynamic, global, enterprising university'. Serving an increasingly international student population, it has put global activity at the heart of its work at all levels, from partnerships with universities and colleges in all continents to the generation of internationally recognized research."},

They employ the techniques of Third Cinema to incite political change through a provocative strategy of deconstructing established narratives. As Getino and Solanas (1971) state: \u201cEvery image that documents, bears witness to,refutes or deepens the truth of a situation is something more than a film image or purely artistic fact; it becomes something which the system finds indigestible.\u201d In this spirit Migrant Media challenges conventional documentary, adopting a position of the filmmakers as the gatherers of resistant imagery.

This paper reports on a scoping study comparing how support services changed during the pandemic at institutions in Germany and Great Britain & Ireland (GBI), exploring how well online MSS worked, and what can be learned for the future. As MSS in Germany differs in history and structure from that in GBI, we contrast results from the two locations. A total of 82 participants from 44 individual institutions answered an online questionnaire. Although at first, support was used less by students, engagement has begun to recover. The survey included questions addressing issues raised in previous studies, and answers showed notable differences between the two jurisdictions. In GBI, service providers felt that students with low confidence or time restrictions can benefit from online provision. In Germany, online spaces for student collaboration without tutoring was found helpful. Even though most respondents want a return to face-to-face, practitioners are aware of the benefits of online support, and it becomes apparent that certain services will still be offered online and could especially serve specific student groups."},

In particular, the impact of the pandemic on the mathematical capabilities of students arriving at university are now starting to be seen and reported. Students arriving at UK universities in 2021, and having completed their A levels in 2021, had received disruption to almost all of their A level learning and it seemed likely that this might cause them to find the transition into higher education more difficult.  Despite the disruption, the number of students achieving the top A level grade has more than doubled since 2019. In this paper, data from a diagnostic test that has remained the same for the past 30 years is considered to measure the mathematical preparedness of students starting their courses at one UK university in September 2021, updating the work of Hodds (2021). Furthermore, an ordinal logistic regression model predicting A level grade based on test performance and other factors is developed to determine if grades were perhaps inflated as suggested. The results show that students entering in 2021 are significantly less prepared for the mathematics on their courses than their colleagues who entered in 2020 and pre-pandemic. The regression model predicts a higher probability of being awarded an A*/A for students with A levels awarded in the pandemic, despite far lower scores on the diagnostic test, and in particular in 2021 when A levels were awarded through teacher assessment of the topics covered and not necessarily the whole A level syllabus."},

Coventry University has been using the same diagnostic test since 1991 and a previous analysis showed students coming to Coventry University in 2001 were performing considerably worse than their counterparts in 1991. Given the changes to A level Mathematics that have taken place since 2001 and the recently implemented reforms to A level Mathematics in the UK, it is timely to review performance in the diagnostic test and to create a benchmark before students enter higher education with the new (linear) A levels. This paper therefore reports on the changing entry competencies of students at Coventry University from 2001 to 2017 and shows that there has been a general improvement in performance across all entry grades. However, students are still not performing at the same level as they were in 1991 and the gap between students with higher entry grades (A level A*\u2013C) and lower entry grades (A level D\u2013E) is getting wider."},

It has been suggested that these students may be those who are mathematics anxious; they may have had previous negative learning experiences with mathematics and thus demonstrate avoidance behaviours such as procrastination and not seeking help. In this paper, the results of mathematical resilience (MR) and anxiety questionnaires (MA) will be investigated. This investigation is conducted at the level of the whole cohort of students and also broken down by a range of demographic features. Consideration is also given to whether there is any relationship between student mathematics anxiety and resilience on the one hand and whether or not they engage with mathematics and statistics support services on the other.The analysis reveals a weak negative correlation between MA and MR at whole cohort level. In terms of demographic characteristics, students on courses with no mathematics A-level entry requirement were significantly more mathematics anxious than those on courses with a mathematics A-level entry-requirement. They were also less mathematically resilient. Female students, non-Asian students, mature students and disabled students, on average, also had higher MA scores, whilst female students and mature students were also significantly less mathematically resilient."},

Therefore there was a fear that students were either being unfairly judged (Arden University, 2020) or would enter university with a reduced understanding of concepts leading to an increase in drop-out rates (Staton, 2020). To measure mathematical ability, diagnostic testing is used at universities. This is now a well-established practice that supports students and their lecturers in discovering areas of mathematical strength and weakness upon entry to a course (Lawson, 2003; Hodds, Shao, and Lawson, 2020). This article compares the entry competencies of students arriving at one UK University in October 2020 with those who entered in previous years, using the same diagnostic test taken by all students as the method for comparison.Students who received their A levels in the year of entry are also compared to those who entered with A levels from years prior, allowing for a fair comparison of students in 2020 in particular. Furthermore, the abilities of students at the different A level grades are also compared. The results showed that students in 2020 appear not to be disadvantaged by the issues caused by the pandemic. On the contrary, many students outperformed colleagues who had summative assessment prior to 2020. "},

In common with other higher education activities, in response to restrictions put in place to reduce the spread of Covid-19, MSS transitioned rapidly to online delivery in spring 2020. This paper reports on thinking within the practitioner community about good practice in the delivery of online MSS. A two-phase approach was used to collect this shared wisdom: an initial questionnaire in May 2020 (just after provision had moved online) and interviews with practitioners in January/February 2021 after colleagues had some experience in online provision and had had the opportunity to reflect on and modify the measures hastily put in place in spring 2020. The focus of the study is not only on what is currently being provided but also on what MSS will look like once all pandemic related restrictions have been ended. The overall feeling of the participants is that face-to-face MSS will return as the dominant form of delivery but that the benefits of online provision are such that a significant minority of provision will remain in this form."},

Despite this, many students come to university ill-prepared for, and struggle with, the mathematical concepts on their course. One particular course where these issues are often prevalent is nursing. Indeed, a lack of numerical ability has been shown to be the main factor in predicting drug calculation ability (McMullan, Jones, and Lea, 2012); a skill that is vital for a safe and successful nursing career (Choudhary and Malthus, 2017). A method that could improve students\u2019 understanding of the mathematics on their course is called \u201cself-explanation training\u201d. Self-explanation training has previously been shown to be successful in improving students\u2019 understanding in various subjects including mathematics and, in particular, mathematical proofs (Hodds, Alcock, and Inglis, 2014). There has, however, been little research on the use of self-explanation training to improve the understanding of mathematics for non-mathematicians. This paper describes a small-scale study (N = 26) that investigated the use of self-explanation training in two forms (a booklet and a video) designed to improve nursing students\u2019 mathematical under-standing. Although performance in the tests was still far from ideal, the results suggest that self-explanation training has the potential to improve nursing students\u2019 understanding of the mathematics on their course and, in particular, significantly improve their ability to solve more complex questions that require greater conceptual understanding."},

But because mathematics majors are expected to learn much of their mathematics by studying proofs, it is important that we understand how to support them in reading and understanding mathematical arguments.

The research reported here explored the potential of active music making for developing students\u2019 spatial-temporal skills and the role this played in improving their progression in mathematics. The study had an experimental design in which a group of 178 children aged 4-6 participated in a music programme containing a variety of musical, predominantly rhythmical, activities. Taking account of the earlier research which suggested that generalist primary teachers are not confident in delivering music lessons and that they feel inadequately prepared during their teacher training (Rogers et al., 2008, Hallam et al, 2009, OFSTED, 2009, Henley, 2011), the music programme created for the current study was aimed at non-specialist teachers. Based around popular nursery rhymes, the activities were easily accessible even for teachers who were not confident in singing in front of their class. The programme addressed the need for clearly specified progression and provided teachers with guidance about how to assess students\u2019 skills and their advancement. All activities were explicitly suited for Foundation Stage (FS) and KS1 pupils and were arranged to promote a range of competencies. To make it accessible for schools, the programme did not require any equipment, resources or staffing which would stretch schools\u2019 budgets. The programme lasted two years and throughout the intervention pupils\u2019 attainment in mathematics, spatial \u2013 temporal reasoning, and music was recorded. This included assessment of specific mathematical and musical skills. Parallel classes made up control groups. Attainment in all areas of measurement was compared between groups to examine the impact of music instruction on learning mathematics. The findings demonstrated that the younger music groups achieved statistically significantly greater progression in mathematics over time than their peers from the control groups. This relationship was observed in the main study and in the combined groups. These results paralleled statistically significantly greater achievement in one or both spatial \u2013 temporal tests. The older groups also recorded statistically significant differences in outcomes in one or both spatial \u2013 temporal tests in all three periods of measurement. These scores were related to higher attainment in mathematics but this change as scores was not sizeable enough to reach statistical significance. When results in specific mathematical skills were considered, only some of them were related to the musical training. The most basic mathematical skills like number recognition to 10, counting to 10 and to 20 were not impacted on by participation in music lessons. Skills related to geometry, 2D and 3D shapes, attributes of shapes, and symmetry patterns, were closely related with the music programme. This was the result of the impact of the music instruction on spatial-temporal abilities. The strong relationship between musical training and arithmetic skills, for example, addition and subtraction, using number line, and problem solving was an unexpected finding. However, as these tasks require mathematical skills related to spatial abilities like number sense and strategy choice, the enhancement of spatial-temporal skills through participation in the rhythmic instruction is likely to have influenced these higher levels of mathematical attainment. The results of the current study cast light on how musical, spatial-temporal, and mathematical skills are intertwined and explored how the music programme might be useful in learning in specific areas of mathematics whilst feeding into the overall mathematical development. These findings provide theoretical and pedagogical knowledge to inform teaching practice. The inexpensive and easy to deliver music programme could enable teachers, who lack confidence in teaching music, to engage their early years and Yr1 pupils in musical activities which would also support the development of mathematical skills."},

As key determinants of O2 availability and delivery, proposed mechanisms contributing to hypoxia include ischemia, alkalemia and pulmonary leukocyte sequestration. However, no study has comprehensively investigated and compared these interrelated mechanisms throughout a typical hemodialysis treatment week. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the physiological mechanisms that contribute to hypoxia during hemodialysis.MethodsIn 76 patients, we measured arterial blood gases and pH at four time-points during hemodialysis (start, 15 min, 60 min, end) over the course of a standard treatment week. For the mid-week hemodialysis session, we additionally measured central hemodynamics (non-invasive cardiac output monitoring) and white blood cell count.ResultsLinear regression modelling identified changes in pH, but not central hemodynamics or white blood cell count, to be predictive of changes in PaO2 throughout hemodialysis (e.g. at 60 min, \u03b2 standardised coefficient pH = 0.45, model R2 = 0.25, P < 0.001). Alkalemia, hypokalemia, decreased calcium, and increased hemoglobin-O2 affinity (leftward shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve) were evident at the end of hemodialysis. pH and hemoglobin-O2 affinity at the start of hemodialysis increased incrementally over the course of a standard treatment week.ConclusionThese data highlight the important role of pH in regulating O2 availability and delivery during hemodialysis. Findings support routine pH monitoring and personalized dialysate bicarbonate prescription to mitigate the significant risk of alkalemia and sub-clinical hypoxia."},

Sedentary behaviour was also significantly different between the centre and home-based groups. The home group spent 52 min less time sedentary compared with the centre-based (CI \u2212106 to 2, p = 0.039). However, after 6 months, the step count and time spent in moderate PA returned to baseline in both the groups.\n\nConclusion: This study provides an important insight into the role of home-based PR which has the potential to be offered as an alternative to the centre-based PR. Understanding who may best respond from the centre or home-based PR warrants further exploration and how to maintain these initial benefits for the long-term.\n\nTrial Registry: ISRCTN: No.: ISRCTN81189044; URL: isrctn.com."},

However, acute cardiopulmonary and metabolic physiology during hemodialysis is not well defined. Intradialytic and interdialytic exercise appear to be beneficial and may alleviate these side effects. To better understand these potential benefits, the acute physiological response to exercise should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare and characterize the acute physiological response during hemodialysis, intradialytic exercise, and interdialytic exercise. Cardiopulmonary physiology was evaluated during three conditions: 1) hemodialysis without exercise (HD), 2) intradialytic exercise (IDEx), and 3) interdialytic exercise (Ex). Exercise consisted of 30-min constant load cycle ergometry at 90% V\u0307O2AT (anaerobic threshold). Central hemodynamics (via noninvasive bioreactance) and ventilatory gas exchange were recorded during each experimental condition. Twenty participants (59\u2009\u00b1\u200912 yr, 16/20 male) completed the protocol. Cardiac output (\u0394 = -0.7\u2009L/min), O2 uptake (\u0394 = -1.4 mL/kg/min), and arterial-venous O2 difference (\u0394 = -2.0 mL/O2/100 mL) decreased significantly during HD. Respiratory exchange ratio exceeded 1.0 throughout HD and IDEx. Minute ventilation was lower (P = 0.001) during IDEx (16.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 L/min) compared with Ex (19.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 L/min). Arterial-venous O2 difference was partially restored further to IDEx (4.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 mL/O2/100 mL) compared with HD (3.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 mL/O2/100 mL). Hemodialysis altered cardiopulmonary and metabolic physiology, suggestive of hypoxia. This dysregulated physiology contributed to a greater physiological demand during intradialytic exercise compared with interdialytic exercise. Despite this, intradialytic exercise partly normalized cardiopulmonary physiology during treatment, which may translate to a reduction in the symptoms and side effects of hemodialysis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first, to our knowledge, to directly compare cardiopulmonary and metabolic physiology during hemodialysis, intradialytic exercise, and interdialytic exercise. Hemodialysis was associated with increased respiratory exchange ratio, blunted minute ventilation, and impaired O2 uptake and extraction. We also identified a reduced ventilatory response during intradialytic exercise compared with interdialytic exercise. Impaired arterial-venous O2 difference during hemodialysis was partly restored by intradialytic exercise. Despite dysregulated cardiopulmonary and metabolic physiology during hemodialysis, intradialytic exercise was well tolerated."},

DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. PARTICIPANTS: Data from 16 Spanish leisure centres (n=3627) and from the 2017 Eurobarometer 472 for Spain (n=1002) were used for this research. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The PA levels were analysed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version, and respondents were grouped into physical inactivity (PIA), moderate-PA and high-PA. Moreover, gender (men or women) and age (18-29 years; 30-44 years; 45-59 years; 60-69 years; \u226570 years) were considered. Total metabolic equivalent (MET)-min/week, as well as total MET-min/week for walking intensity, moderate intensity and vigorous intensity were recorded. RESULTS: Leisure centres showed a lower prevalence of PIA and a higher prevalence of high-PA than the general population (p<0.05). Women displayed a higher prevalence of PIA and lower prevalence of high-PA than men (p<0.05). The prevalence of PIA increases with age while the prevalence of high-PA decreases. CONCLUSION: Leisure centres engage most of their members in regular PA, including women and older adults, and these members also perform a higher number of MET in vigorous PA, than the general population."},

Additionally, there has been no concerted effort to map program characteristics. Objective: To understand what key delivery approaches are currently used within exercise referral schemes in England. Methods: Across England, a total of 30 schemes with a combined total of 85,259 exercise referral scheme participants completed a Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template-guided questionnaire. The questionnaire explored program delivery, nonexercise components, and program management. Results: Results found that program delivery varied, though many schemes were typically 12 weeks in length, offering participants 2 exercise sessions in a fitness gym or studio per week, using a combination of exercises. Adherence was typically measured through attendance, with nonexercise components and program management varying by scheme.

The aim of the authors was to summarize the effectiveness of structured interventions upon PA outcomes, in addition to proportions of individuals adopting and maintaining PA, and adherence and retention rates. Methods: Systematic review with narrative synthesis and exploratory meta-analyses. Twelve studies were included. Results: Effectiveness on PA levels during adoption (pre- to first time point) showed a trivial standardized effect (0.15 [\u22120.06 to 0.36]); during maintenance (any time point after the first and >6 mo since initiation) the standardized effect was also trivial with a wide interval estimate (0.19 [\u22120.68 to 1.07]). Few studies reported adoption (k\u2009=\u20093) or maintenance rates (k\u2009=\u20092).

Methods: Data were obtained from 5246 participants from 12 different ERSs, lasting 6-12 weeks. The preexercise referral scheme and changes from the preexercise to the postexercise referral scheme in self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire scores were examined. A 2-stage individual patient data meta-analysis was used to generate the effect estimates. Results: For the pre-ERS metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, the estimate (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 676 MET minutes per week (539 to 812). For the change in MET minutes per week, the estimate (95% CI) was an increase of 540 MET minutes per week (396 to 684). Changes in the total PA levels occurred as a result of increases in vigorous activity of 17 minutes (95% CI, 9 to 24), increases in moderate activity of 29 minutes (95% CI, 22 to 36), and reductions in sitting of \u221261 minutes (95% CI, \u221278 to \u221243), though little change in walking (\u22125 min; 95% CI, \u221214 to 5) was found.

However, no review or meta-analysis has compared the effects of HIIT to non-exercising controls in MetS variables. The aim of this study was to determine through a systematic review, the effectiveness of HIIT on MetS clinical variables in adults.Methods: Studies had to be randomised controlled trials, lasting at least 3 weeks, and compare the effects of HIIT on at least one of the MetS clinical variables [fasting blood glucose (BG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) triglyceride (TG), systolic (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and waist circumference (WC)] compared to a control group. The methodological quality of the studies selected was evaluated using the PEDro scale.Results: Ten articles fulfilled the selection criteria, with a mean quality score on the PEDro scale of 6.7. Compared with controls, HIIT groups showed significant and relevant reductions in BG (\u2212 0.11 mmol/L), SBP (\u2212 4.44 mmHg), DBP (\u2212 3.60 mmHg), and WC (\u2212 2.26 cm). Otherwise, a slight increase was observed in HDL-C (+ 0.02 mmol/L). HIIT did not produce any significant changes in TG (\u2212 1.29 mmol/L).Conclusions: HIIT improves certain clinical aspects in people with MetS (BG, SBP, DBP and WC) compared to people with MetS who do not perform physical exercise. Plausible physiological changes of HIIT interventions might be related with large skeletal muscle mass implication, improvements in the vasomotor control, better baroreflex control, reduction of the total peripheral resistance, increases in excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and changes in appetite and satiety mechanisms."},

The questionnaire evaluated exercise provider\u2018s qualifications, materials, delivery, location, tailoring, dosage, and compliance. Data collected were used solely for observations of scheme characteristics acrossthe UK at the present time.323RESULTS: Schemes were typically 12 weeks in length (76%), offered patients two unsupervised exercise sessions in fitness gyms per week (79%), and used a combination of cardiovascular, resistance, free weights, and body weight exercises. Determining progression for resistance exercises was based upon the number of reps and sets completed (76%); for cardiovascular exercisesprogression was based upon the rating of perceived effort (38%); and for other exercises progression was based upon performance (45%). Just over half of schemes offered a variety of home based exercise components (52%), whether it was just advice or a full exercise programme. Adherence was typically measured through attendance (55%). Common motivational strategies usedwere goal setting (72%), goal achievement (69%), and acknowledgement of success (62%).CONCLUSION: This research provides useful insights of schemes\u2018 characteristics across England and Scotland. This evidence can support the development of a larger-scale mapping exercise to review further schemes across the whole of the UK, which to date has been lacking.

Cardiovascular risk is elevated in end-stage renal disease. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is linked to repetitive transient ischaemia occurring during haemodialysis (HD). Cardiomyocyte ischaemia results in \u2018cardiac stunning\u2019, evidenced by regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs). Ischaemic RWMA have been documented during HD resulting in maladaptive cardiac remodelling and increased risk of heart failure. Intra-dialytic exercise is well tolerated and can improve quality of life and functional capacity. It may also attenuate HD-induced cardiac stunning.Methods. This exploratory study aimed to assess the effect of intra-dialytic cycle ergometry on cardiac stunning. Twentyexercise-na\u0131\u00a8ve participants on maintenance HD (mean 6 SD, 59 6 11 years) underwent resting echocardiography and maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Subsequently, cardiac stunning was assessed with myocardial strain-derived RWMAs at four time points during (i) standard HD and (ii) HD with 30 min of sub-maximal intra-dialytic cycle ergometry at a workload equivalent to 90% oxygen uptake at the anaerobic threshold (VO2AT). Central haemodynamics and cardiac troponin I were also assessed.Results. Compared with HD alone, HD with intra-dialytic exercise significantly reduced RWMAs after 2.5 h of HD (total 110 6 4, mean 7 6 4 segments versus total 77 6 3, mean 5 6 3, respectively; P \u00bc 0.008).

Method: This review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42017070845). We systematically searched Medline/PubMed (EBSCOhost), Science Direct (Elsevier ScienceDirect), Scopus (Scopus), SPORTDiscus (SPORTDiscus), Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Complete, and PsychINFO databases, with the final literature search taking place on 15th March 2018. Intervention studies that reported a pre- and a post-intervention measure of CRF and AP or EF and a control group were included. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes for CRF, AP, and EF (and sub-domains of EF; inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) and meta-regression was used to examine associations between moderators and outcomes. Results: A total of 13 studies (4,397 children and adolescents, aged 6-15 years old) were included. Pooled effect size (Hedges g) estimates [95% confidence intervals] were: 0.67 [95% CI = 0.08, 1.25] for CRF, -0.06 [95% CI = -0.17, 0.06] for AP, and 0.06 [95% CI = -0.02, 0.15] for EF.

The mixed-effect meta-regression models showed that the amount of change in CRF was not significantly associated with the PA interventions effect on AP, with an effect size estimate of 0.16 [95% CI = -0.44, 0.11], or on EF, with an effect size estimate of 0.14 [95% CI = -0.14, 0.42]. Conclusions: Significant positive effects were found for CRF after PA interventions. No significant effects were found for AP or EF and CRF change was not associated with their changes. However, it should be noted that most of the PA interventions took place during time allocated to the curriculum teaching, and no negative impact on AP or EF from the additional PA was found.

Participants self-reported IPAQ scores pre- and post- scheme completion to determine if exercise referral had any impact on PA levels. Schemes were 12 weeks in length and situated in leisure environments including gyms, leisure centres and community halls, throughout the UK. Exercise prescriptions consisted of both aerobic and resistance training. Two-stage individual patient data meta-analysis was performed separately on the pre-ERS, and on the change scores (post- minus pre-ERS scores), for metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week; analysis was chosen due to data being hierarchal and accounting for clustering at scheme level.\n\nRESULTS: Analyses were conducted on the continuous data collected through the IPAQ. For pre-ERS MET-minutes the estimate from random effects model was 1183 MET-minutes per week [911 to 1457], p< 0.0001). For ERS change, the estimate from random effects model for was 666 MET-minutes per week [385 to 948], p< 0.0001).

We determined if a structured home-based unsupervised PR programme was non-inferior to supervised centre-based PR for participants with COPD.Methods A total of 287 participants with COPD who were referred to PR (187 male, mean (SD) age 68 (8.86) years, FEV1% predicted 48.34 (17.92)) were recruited. They were randomised to either centre-based PR or a structured unsupervised home-based PR programme including a hospital visit with a healthcare professional trained in motivational interviewing, a self-management manual and two telephone calls. Fifty-eight (20%) withdrew from the centre-based group and 51 (18%) from the home group. The primary outcome was dyspnoea domain in the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire Self-Report; CRQ-SR) at 7\u2009weeks. Measures were taken blinded. We undertook a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) complete case analysis, comparing groups according to original random allocation and with complete data at follow-up. The non-inferiority margin was 0.5 units.Results There was evidence of significant gains in CRQ-dyspnoea at 7\u2009weeks in both home and centre-based groups. There was inconclusive evidence that home-based PR was non-inferior to PR in dyspnoea (mean group difference, mITT: \u22120.24, 95%\u2009CI \u22120.61 to 0.12, p=0.18), favouring the centre group at 7\u2009weeks.Conclusions The standardised home-based programme provides benefits in dyspnoea. Further evidence is needed to definitively determine if the health benefits of the standardised home-based programme are non-inferior or equivalent to supervised centre-based rehabilitation.Trial registration number ISRCTN81189044"},

Few centres, however, use a structured approach by providing a weekly physical activity (PA) program meeting ACSM guidelines.\nPURPOSE: To assess attendance and retention rates in inactive middle-aged adults of a fitness centre between a traditional PA plan and a structured PA program meeting ACSM guidelines.\nMETHODOLOGY: Eighty inactive middle-aged adults (44.32 \u00b1 6.99 years; 77.89 \u00b1 19.22 kg; 158.75 \u00b1 36.08 cm) from a Spanish fitness centre voluntarily enrolled in this study.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to two groups (Free Exercise [FE = 40]; Structured Program [SP = 40]) and proved to be inactive through IPAQ short version. Participants completed baseline measures including body composition, VO2 max, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose, flexibility, and muscular strength. During the ensuing 12 weeks, weekly attendance of both the FE and SP groups were tracked, with both groups initially agreeing to exercise 2-3 days per week for at least 20 sessions. FE group was introduced to trainers of the fitness centre and informed of group exercise sessions available. SP group received a structured program based on ACSM guidelines for PA.\nRESULTS: No baseline differences (p>0.05) existed between groups for age, body composition, VO2 max, haematocrit, flexibility, and muscular strength. A total of 13 participants (16%) never attend the initial assessment, and only 20 members (25%) attended 20 days or more (FE=5 [12.5%]; SP=15 [37.5%]).

At present, the literature reviewing the impact of exercise referral schemes on PA levels, well-being, and quality of life is inconsistent.\n\nPURPOSE: To determine if exercise referral schemes positively influence PA levels in a large cohort of of individuals throughout England.\n\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from 7412 participants (Female N= 4965 [49.96, +/- 14.37y., Male N=2447 [53.15, +/- 14.75 y.) referred from hospitals (N=605), medical centres (N=406), outreach (N=353) and GP surgeries (N= 6048) to fourteen exercise referral schemes located across England. The participants\u2019 self-reported MET/minutes per week were calculated at the start and end of the scheme to determine whether the clinical exercise intervention had any impact on participants\u2019 PA levels. Scheme lengths were either 6 (N=1749) or 12 weeks (N= 5663) in duration and situated in leisure environments. PA programmes consisted of both aerobic and resistance training tailored to the individual. A paired samples t-test was conducted to determine if a statistically significant difference existed between pre- and post scheme PA levels.\n\nRESULTS: METS/minutes per week were combined for both the 6- and 12-week groups. There was a statistically significant increase of 290.9 MET/mins per week from pre- to post-scheme for the participants (Pre= 856.1, +/- 1278 MET/min/week, 95% CI [827, 885) to Post= 1147 +/- 1801 MET/min/week; t(7411) = -34.18, p<0.001, 95% CI [1475, 1509), with a pairwise correlation of 0.367.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This is one of the larger samples to study PA levels in UK adults after completion of an exercise referral scheme. The results showed a significant pre-post increase in MET/min/week, although sustainability of this change is not known. Long-term follow up of participants, including a comparison group and deeper analysis of other health behaviors, is to be conducted to support the initial findings."},

Prevalence of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) can be as high as 20-30%, contributing to subclinical, transient myocardial ischemia. In the long term, this results in progressive, maladaptive cardiac remodeling and impairment of left ventricular function. This is thought to be a major contributor to increased cardiovascular mortality in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Medical strategies to acutely attenuate haemodynamic instability during HD are suboptimal. Whilst a programme of intradialytic exercise training appears to facilitate numerous chronic adaptations, little is known of the acute physiological response to this type of exercise. In particular, the potential for intradialytic exercise to acutely stabilise cardiovascular hemodynamics, thus preventing IDH and myocardial ischemia, has not been explored. This narrative review aims to summarise the characteristics and causes of acute haemodynamic instability during HD, with an overview of current medical therapies to treat IDH. Moreover, we discuss the acute physiological response to intradialytic exercise with a view to determining the potential for this nonmedical intervention to stabilise cardiovascular haemodynamics during HD, improve coronary perfusion, and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ESRD."},

This systematic review aims to provide anoverview, and examine the impact, of exercise referral schemes in patients with cardiovascular, mental health, and musculoskeletal disorders. This review focuses on populations within the United Kingdom (UK) only, with an aim toinform national exercise referral policies and guidelines.Method: Data was collected from specific sources using validated methodology through PRISMA. Systematic searches were performed using Locate, PubMed, Scopus and Pro Quest: Public Health databases. Thirteen studiesmet inclusion criteria set for each sub group. This included that all studies aimed to prevent, observe, or decrease ill-health relating to the disorder, participants over the age of sixteen, and health disorders and outcomes were reviewed. All studies were conducted in the UK only.Results: In the 13 articles, a variety of modes and types of exercise were utilised. One-to-one supervised exercise sessions based in a gym environment were most frequently employed. Results showed that longer length schemes(20+ weeks) produced better health outcomes, and had higher adherence to physical activity prescribed, than those of shorter length (8\u201312 weeks). In patients referred with cardiovascular disorders, cardiovascular-relatedmeasures showed significant decreases including blood pressure. Schemes increased physical activity levels over the length of scheme for all disorders.Conclusion: Longer length schemes (20+ weeks) improved adherence to physical activity prescribed over the course of the scheme, and could support longer term exercise adherence upon completion, however additional research on larger samples should examine this further. An implication is that schemes currently recommended in guidelines do not tailor programmes to support long term adherence to exercise, which must be addressed. There is currently a lack of research examining programmes tailored to suit the individual\u2019s health conditions thus further research might allow providers to tailor delivery and build upon policy recommendations in the UK"},

PA has been shown to impact upon hospitalisation and is one of the best predictors of all-cause mortality in patients with COPD (Waschki et al., 2011, Chest, 140(2), 331\u2013342). However, there is limited data on PA in relation to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines with most authors reporting PA as total time above 3 metabolic equivalents (METs) and not in bouts of at least 10 consecutive minutes. Completing PA in bouts of consecutive minutes of at least 10 min rather than totalling individual minutes of non-bouts activity is important to ensure health benefits are gained. The aim of this study was to describe the PA levels of patients with COPD in accordance with disease severity and to examine the impact of using non-bouts and bouts of PA in determining if the ACSM guidelines have been met. With National Research Ethics Service (NRES) ethical approval, 154 patients with COPD (mean (s): age 68 (8) years; BMI 27 (6) m \u00b7 kg\u22122; FEV1% predicted 49 (18)%) were consented as part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Patients were categorised according to Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, with grade 5 being the most severe. Patients were instructed to wear a SenseWear Pro 2 armband for all waking hours on 5 standardised days. Outcome measures were step count and time above 3 METs. Mean (s) daily step count was 3919 (2624) steps. There was a statistically significant difference between step count and MRC dyspnoea grade. Those in MRC grade 5 (2382 (2046) steps) had significantly less steps than MRC dyspnoea grades 2 (5824 (3027) steps, P \u2264 0.01), 3 (3908 (2162) steps, P \u2264 0.01) and 4 (3278 (2351) steps, P \u2264 0.01). Mean (s) daily time over 3 METs was 58 (48) min (67% meeting guidelines), which reduced to 15 (22) min (18% meeting guidelines) once data in at least 10 consecutive minute bouts were analysed (P \u2264 0.01). Patients with COPD are inactive. Levels of PA decline with increasing MRC grade and are lowest in those with higher levels of dyspnoea. There is a significant reduction in time in PA and the number of patients meeting the ACSM guidelines when using the 10-min bout data in comparison with non-bout data. How PA is reported can affect the interpretation and if not reported in bouts of at least 10 min may mask the need for PA intervention."},

To investigate the use of accelerometers to monitor change in physical activity in a childhood obesity treatment intervention. Methods. 28 children aged 7-13 taking part in \"Families for Health\" were asked to wear an accelerometer (Actigraph) for 7-days, and complete an accompanying activity diary, at baseline, 3-months and 9-months. Interviews with 12 parents asked about research measurements. Results. Over 90% of children provided 4 days of accelerometer data, and around half of children provided 7 days. Adequately completed diaries were collected from 60% of children. Children partake in a wide range of physical activity which uniaxial monitors may undermonitor (cycling, nonmotorised scootering) or overmonitor (trampolining). Two different cutoffs (4\u2009METS or 3200\u2009counts\u00b7min(-1)) for minutes spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) yielded very different results, although reached the same conclusion regarding a lack of change in MVPA after the intervention. Some children were unwilling to wear accelerometers at school and during sport because they felt they put them at risk of stigma and bullying. Conclusion. Accelerometers are acceptable to a majority of children, although their use at school is problematic for some, but they may underestimate children's physical activity."},

Walk tests are easy to administer, appear to be well tolerated by patients and may represent a more meaningful measure for a patient group as they assess capability as well as fitness. However, the use of walk tests for the assessment of functional capacity in maintenance dialysis patients has received scant attention. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of a walking-stair-climbing test to predict VO2 peak in non-anaemic maintenance dialysis patients.METHODS: In the validation phase of the study, 14 subjects completed a cycle ergometer-graded exercise test (GXT) for the determination of VO2 peak and a walking-stair-climbing task (WALK), each separated by a period of 7 days. Three weeks later, 18 subjects completed two WALK tests, each separated by a period of at least 48 h, to facilitate reliability estimation. Estimates of differentiated and undifferentiated ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were obtained during and immediately consequent to all exercise tests.RESULTS: VO2 peak (ml kg min) was significantly correlated with total WALK time (s) (r = -0.83; P < 0.001). VO2 peak (ml/kg/min) could be predicted from total WALK time with a standard error of prediction of 11%. Reliability assessment revealed no significant differences for any aspect of the WALK test performance, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from r = 0.71 (RPElegs) to 0.96 (total WALK time).CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the WALK test is a valid, reliable and potentially useful method by which to assess the functional capacity of non-anaemic maintenance dialysis patients."},

What makes her emergence possible along the intersections of the vernacular, the colonial, the modern, and the contemporary? In this chapter, I focus on the discursive formation of the binabayi (the transfeminine). The chapter consists of three parts. I begin by articulating a theory of transfeminine subjectivity through an explication of vernacular consciousness, a description of the possibilities of performance from the vernacular itself, and a trans critique of both concepts of consciousness and performance. Then, I suggest a decolonial reading of transfemininity by looking at the appearances of the binabayi in lexicons during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines. Finally, I offer a trans reading of an assemblage of contemporary Filipinx fiction: Vincent Empimano's \u2018Utoy\u2019 (\u2018Little Boy\u2019), Joe Henry B.

Since then, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera have been known for inspiring a movement of the gender-diverse community within what was called the Stonewall Uprising. Yet Stonewall was not just a local occurrence, as far as trans communities all over the world are concerned. Johnson\u2019s and Rivera\u2019s acts reverberated beyond New York; their struggles have inspired gender-diverse people globally to take courage in laying the ground for their own revolutions.In 1992, the first national meeting of Brazilian trans women and travestis took place in Rio de Janeiro. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional de Travestis e Transexuais (ANTRA) was founded.1 In 2004, a group of trans women in Brazil entered the National Congress building for the first time to reclaim their rights, marking what is called the first Dia da Visibilidade Trans (Trans Visibility Day)in Brazil. A couple of years later, the country also saw the establishment of a couple of other organisations dedicated to the fight for trans rights.In 2002, the first organisation of trans women in the Philippines was established by a group of women in Metro Manila who called themselves the Society of Transsexual Women of the Philippines (STRAP). Soon after, the Coalition for the Liberation of the Reassigned Sex (COLORS), Gender and Development Advocates (GANDA) Filipinas, the Association of Transgender People in the Philippines (ATP), the Transpinay Association of Antipolo (TAO), and clinics dedicated to and initiated by Filipina trans women like Victoria by Love Yourself and Diossa by Lily were also established in the archipelago.2"},

Such gesture is imperative. It can only enable modes of identity outside this \"always already\" inclusive matrix to speak for themselves, a position that is not always assured by the frames of the postcolonial, the modern, and their hybridities.1A tropic opportunity that is summoned in many circles is the individual standing in for the collective (or the personal becoming the political), so that the one and the many may be deemed to imagine entry to a utopia only characterized by equality, precisely because \"gender\" had been opened up to be dissimulating or transitive, in the first place. The thought that this linguistic model is prone to lapses in inclusivity should be humbling, at the same time that reminds us of how much of what is yet to be done must begin with an intimately recalcitrant encounter with language: why it misapprehends, what it disavows, how it silences."},

The project asks: What are the words used to refer to \"modern\", \"contemporary\" and \"art\" in Southeast Asia? What do these terms denote and connote? When and how did they historically emerge? How do terminologies align or differ in the region's many vernaculars? How do ideas of modernity, contemporaneity and art itself become mobile and take flight when shifting between languages? There are many dis-crepancies in the nature of these nine languages, as well as in the sources available on them, and the style, tone and scope of each author's contribution. This report is offered as an epistemic and lexical resource for further research. It is anticipated that greater attention to terminological shifts in Southeast Asia's languages may facilitate new perspectives, including new possibilities for comparative work that remains attentive to local and linguistic specificities."},

It is made up of five episodes: Essence, Honeymoon, Crisis, Adaptation and Homecoming. It is the film component of Emmanuel Johnson's autoethnographic PhD study which explores the question of what it means to be educated in Nigerian student experience. In response to the question of what it means to be educated in Nigerian student experience, the study concludes that, it means: to possess value and knowledge that legitimises the Nigerian identity. This understanding is guided by ideas of key scholars such as R.S. Peters (1966; 1967), Craft (1984) and Hirst and Peters (1970), who provide definitions of education which is explored in the thesis component of the study. This idea of value and knowledge that legitimises the Nigerian identity, is explored in part III of the thesis. The idea of \u2018legitimacy\u2019 is linked to an Ibibio phrase that is mentioned in one of the five episodes of the film series, called \u2018aman isong\u2019, which can be translated as \u2018belonging to the land\u2019. Thus, the idea of \u2018belonging\u2019 to one\u2019s native land is indicative of a sense of belonging, which is found in the Nigerian identity. This study emphasises the importance of the Nigerian identity and argues that, an \u2018education\u2019 that does not help provide this sense of legitimacy, may not be an education at all for Nigerian students. Because a Nigerian awarded such education may struggle with feelings of loneliness, born from a lack of legitimacy of their Nigerian identity. Emmanuel uses participatory film in this study through a lens of autoethnography, which means personal experiences as researcher influence the narrative of the film series. The film series capture visual narratives of Nigerian student experience, to help viewers engage with study findings in a deep and immersive way. The film series are titled after the phrase \u2018becoming Nigerian\u2019, which is discussed in this thesis as a desire of Nigerian students to attain a sense of legitimacy in the world for their Nigerian identity.

We contribute to this debate by drawing on PISA 2018 data from a total of 61,722 students, 2528 schools, and nine countries. For our investigation, we test multiple associated measurement models for convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity, model fit, and measurement invariance. For the PISA 2018 sample, we found very little variation in student well-being both between schools and between countries suggesting that variation in student well-being exists predominantly within respective school contexts. In addition, our findings support the notion that student life-satisfaction should be split into separate general and school-based factors in a Bi-Dimensional Life-Satisfaction Model. Moreover, results suggest that PISA 2018 data can be used to successfully measure a Four-Factor Hedonic Model of Student Well-being, tackling both cognitive (general life-satisfaction and satisfaction with school factors) and affective features (positive and negative affect). Finally, we propose a Five-Factor Integrative Model of Student Well-being that supports a broader conceptualization of student well-being that includes life-satisfaction, both positive and negative affect, and eudaemonia. We tested this model and found that it met the requirements for scalar invariance across male and female gender groups. However, for all 36 inter-country tests of measurement invariance, metric invariance was only reached nine times (25%), and scalar invariance was reached once (2.8%). Implications and recommendations for follow up research are provided."},

To investigate this problem, the authors draw on the 2018 TALIS dataset involving a survey of 5201 Kazakhstani teachers from 275 participating schools. The study, framed by Chapman\u2019s teacher attrition model, uses a nested data design. As an outcome variable, the authors make use of a corollary of attrition, the self-reported career commitment variable in the Kazakhstani TALIS dataset. The analysis suggests that teachers who enter the profession with enhanced altruistic tendencies have improved self-efficacy and job satisfaction. Further, teaching-as-a-first-career-choice appears to drive both job satisfaction and career commitment, while learning to manage behaviour and mixed-ability settings also appears to drive improved long-term career commitment.

The study found that the PT market expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 750 out of the 952 participants (81%) received PT. Lack of parental follow-up, limited preparation by schoolteachers on how to deliver online classes during the pandemic, and insufficient support by regular schools for students taking university entrance examinations prompted the participants to seek PT, mainly to obtain state tuition grants for highly selective universities. Despite the health risks of face-to-face PT during the COVID-19 pandemic, several participants did take part in it. The participants exercised their agency by reflecting not only on the drawbacks of online PT but also its advantages, including saving time, energy, and money and being able to revisit the taught material several times, thus, enhancing comprehension. The pedagogical implications of fair access to higher education and regulating PT by introducing codes of practice are presented."},

The review strategy included systematically searching the Turkish Academic Network and Information Center (ULAKBIM) and Scopus. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram guided the review and reporting process.FindingsThree key themes emerged: (1) perceptions, attitudes and behaviors; (2) psychological resources, learning and innovation and (3) school climate and culture. The results indicated that the research evidence on TSL in the review did not correspond well with the evidence on TSL in non-Western contexts. The authors also discussed the state of research narratively to provide an overview of the topical foci and methodological and conceptual trends.Research limitations/implicationsFirst, although the databases of the study are claimed to be regularly updated locally, these two search databases may inevitably have missed some journal articles relevant to the inclusion criteria. A possible solution is to include more databases like ERIC, PsycArticles, SAGE, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, Web of Science and ProQuest. Second, the authors decided to limit the exploration of journal articles on transformative leadership to peer-reviewed journal articles. The authors might have missed a wider range of insights available in book chapters, books, research papers, dissertations and gray literature. Third, as there were many levels of research foci, the authors did the coding on research foci and methods. However, the approach may not allow authors to explore the relationships between research foci and method design. One possible solution is to do all coding in one file so that more complex analysis can follow. Finally, the authors agree that TSL is only one leadership style that is related to leadership effectiveness and that effective leadership is multi-faceted and requires a combination of leadership styles. Accordingly, the evidence in the study sheds light on only one dimension of leadership effectiveness.Originality/valueOur review is part of an effort to demonstrate the importance of a culturally-situated understanding of TSL and to develop a globally validated knowledge base. It identifies and summarizes research in a non-Western school context defined by centrality, lack of autonomy and accountability."},

The study draws on an international sample of 11,582 students from 534 schools in 20 countries and focuses on PISA schools that catered to a mix of 1G and 2G students. The study explores the role that student attributes, student-perceived peer and parental support, school provisions, and school equity-oriented policies have on immigrant student academic achievement. The analysis involved specifying three separate stepwise multi-level regression models for mathematics, science, and reading achievement. Findings suggested that, at the within-school level, perceived parental support and teacher enthusiasm and the adaption of instruction were associated with improved academic performance, while student experience of bullying was associated with more substantive negative academic outcomes. At the between-school level, the opportunity to participate in creative extracurricular activities was associated with improved academic performance. In contrast, a higher proportion of 1G students and the overall perceived level of bullying of immigrant students were associated with substantively negative academic outcomes between schools. Tests of moderation effects suggested that parental emotional support appeared to be of particular relevance to 1G students\u2019 math and reading outcomes, while enhanced SES status appeared to be specifically relevant to improved science and reading outcomes for 1G students.

Further, the study elaborates on h-classics publications to obtain an in-depth understanding of the most influential scientific outputs in this domain. Key findings of the study are that research on shadow education (a) has experienced steady growth over the last decade; (b) is disseminated through a wide range of outlets, mainly in the disciplines of sociology of education, economics of education, educational psychology, and language education; (c) is published mainly by scholars working in East Asia and the United States; (d) has focused on tangible (quantifiable) benefits related to improved examination results; and (e) reveals how this form of instruction primarily benefits students hailing from high socioeconomic backgrounds, thereby contributing to greater educational inequality.

Using methodological triangulation that combines semi-structured interviews, participant observation, interactive training sessions, and archival data, we identify four leadership practices that shape a climate conducive to innovation in these schools: a) fostering the creativity of the members of school society or community, b) developing a collaborative learning ecosystem, c) encouraging innovative teaching through online collaborative learning spaces and ICT, and d) empowering teachers to generate an adaptable curriculum in a flexible work environment. Findings indicate the significance of building a collaborative ecosystem that enables a separation or departure from the mainstream traditional and test-oriented education system in Turkey, which in turn inspires the creativity of teachers and students in the fabric of daily school life."},

Using ICT Engagement Theory as a theoretical framework and a three-level hierarchical linear modeling approach, while controlling for confounding effects, ICT-related independent variables of interest were added to the models at the student, school, and country levels. The series of models revealed that, in general, an increase in ICT availability and ICT use both inside and outside school had a negative association with learning outcomes, while students\u2019 positive attitude toward ICT demonstrated a strong positive relationship. However, students\u2019 perceived autonomy related to ICT use had the strongest association with academic performance, which is consistent with the changing nature of the modern learning environments. Findings revealed that virtually all forms of student ICT use, both inside and outside of school and whether subject related or not, had no substantive positive relationship with student performance in math or science. Conversely, higher student attitude toward, confidence in, belief in utility of, and autonomous use of ICT was associated with higher math and science performance for each of the four years of the study. Incidentally, we also found that while country GDP per capita had no consistent association with student performance, a school\u2019s provision of extra-curricula activities did. Recommendations for educational leaders, teachers, and parents are offered."},

The structural equation model that yielded the best fit indicated that as teach-ers\u2019 self-efficacy levels increase, their stress, burnout, depression, and intent-to-leave levels decrease. Teachers with high self-efficacy are less likely to develop intention-to-leave because of their positive affective well-being indicators. Results suggest that maths and science teachers who have optimistic beliefs in their capabilities can more easily cope with the stressors at work and have better affective well-being, and consequently, a lower level of intention-to-leave.

The increasing number of students with learning difficulties associated with neurodiversity entering higher education (HE) poses a shared and growing challenge internationally for teachers and institutional leaders. This narrative synthesis draws together a corpus of international literature on how neurodiverse students experience higher education and the ways in which higher education institutions respond to the cluster of neurodiverse conditions. A systematic review was carried out to search, retrieve, appraise and synthesize the available evidence to provide an original contribution to the literature and significant insights of worth to higher education internationally. An inclusive approach to data extraction was used to ensure that all the relevant studies were included. All stages of the review process, including the initial search, screening, sample selection and analysis, are described. Three main themes and 11 subthemes were identified. Although the majority of publications focus on either dyslexia, autistic spectrum disorder, or ADHD, some common themes are evident in student experience across learning difficulties associated with neurodiversity. Although support services and technologies are available to meet students\u2019 specific needs, there is an apparent dislocation between the two. Fear of stigmatization and labelling worsens the divide between what is needed and what is available to ensure neurodiverse students\u2019 success in higher education, where good intentions are evidently not enough."},

The study was carried out in Elazig city on teachers working in public and private high schools. Taking in the whole population, the questionnaire was administered to 1,017 teachers.FindingsThe results show that teachers' commitment focuses, their types and levels of commitment to these focuses vary according to their personal characteristics such as gender, marital status and tenure. Although female teachers are more affectively and normatively committed to the teaching profession than their male counterparts, they have low levels of normative commitment to the work group and low levels of continuance commitment (based on lack of investments) to the school in which they work. Married teachers are less affectively and normatively committed to the teaching profession than unmarried ones. However, married teachers' continuance commitment levels to the teaching profession and to the school in which they work are higher. As tenure increases, perceptions of investments having been made in schools increase and therefore teachers' continuance commitment levels to the focus of the school in which they work increase. Although one\u2010to\u2010five year tenured teachers have the highest levels of normative commitment to the teaching profession, they are the least affectively and normatively committed to the focus of work group.Research limitations/implicationsThe focus of the study is teachers working at high schools. Teachers working at various school levels may be committed to different focuses or to the same focus at different levels. It may be that a larger study across school levels would have revealed differences across them. Also, the underlying reasons why some teachers are committed to some focuses may be probed more profoundly.Practical implicationsKeeping in mind the importance of teachers' commitment to various focuses and its effects on school effectiveness, educational leaders should take necessary measures to remedy the troubles which cause teachers' lack of commitment. In this context, school leaders may attempt to strengthen: female teachers' weak normative bonds to the work group, married teachers' weak affective and normative bonds to the teaching profession, and new teachers' weak affective and normative bonds to the work group. The findings reveal the need for more supportive and integrative managerial actions to raise teachers' levels of commitment. School leaders may be more concerning and develop special strategies contingent on their employees' personal characteristics to create high commitment workplaces.Originality/valueThe relevant literature shows that the types and levels of teachers' commitment focuses are quite an under\u2010researched area and the study has contributed to one's understanding of these issues."},

In this regard, the ability to effectively engage with technologies for educational purposes is now part of the basic knowledge, skills and attitudes to be expected from anyone in the teaching profession. Accentuated by the proliferation of technology-mediated situations resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, but linked to a longer-term trend, dealing with the digital is also now an almost unavoidable aspect of active participation in society and civic engagement. Indeed, the notion of \u2018postdigital\u2019 is rapidly gaining traction as a way to highlight that the digital and non-digital cannot be really separated anymore and, due to this fact, (post)digital citizenship is emerging as a core competence for citizens. Still, the way digitally competent educators are expected to support learners in their development as digital citizens is not explored enough. To contribute to closing this gap, this paper reviews 24 teacher competence frameworks from different regions of the world and makes the case for considering educators\u2019 critical digital literacy as a key leverage to building digital (post)citizenship and fostering ethical uses of technology. The analysis reveals that critical digital literacy is mostly missing and, hence, the paper closes with a set of recommendations for policymakers and institutional leaders in the education sector on how to incorporate critical aspects of digital literacy in educators\u2019 professional development activities, so that teachers and trainers can operate as a much needed vector to develop (post)digital citizenship across our societies."},

We will briefly share how an international cohort of doctoral candidates was recruited for the dual award programme in order to meet the funders\u2019 profiling and equity targets and explain how the research programme itself is addressing complex challenges in contemporary higher education in South Africa and the UK.  The aim of the discussion is to centre our ideas around doctorate supervision of fellow academics in virtual Borderland spaces (Billot et al., 2021). The use of \u201cborder\u201d not only referring to geo-political borders across our education landscapes, but also the territorial borders linked to research knowledge versus indigenous and societal knowledge (Le Grange, 2012; Mignolo & Tlostanova, 2006).

Play is considered an enabling instrument for equipping young people with the relevant skills to manage the realities of tomorrow, where play is the freedom for them to engage with, develop curiosity about, and learn from the world and people that surround them in positive ways. Acknowledging that there is a link between play and the development of a range of competences young people will need to flourish, this paper proposes a mapping framework towards articulating the relationships between the aspects of play, the competencies that playful learning may afford, and the types of resilience that these competencies may develop. Such a mapping approach can be used to analyse and form considerations for the design of playful educational activities. The mapping is co-created with the ACES partners in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, and the approach takes inspirations from Arnab et al. (2015)\u2019s Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LMGM) mapping model which has been extended to consider motivational theory (Proulx et al., 2017).  The paper will present the mapping framework of the aforementioned aspects and provide a mapping example using the \u201cSTEMBucket\u201d programme in Malaysia, which is designed to engage teachers and learners in playful STEM activities towards social innovation and resilience development."},

This explosive spread has elicited a diverse set of academic and theoretically inclined responses which will be touched on and discussed throughout this chapter. Specifically, this chapter highlights a plural set of critiques built on trans-disciplinary pedagogical, political and philosophical grounds. In parallel to the above mentioned academic response, however, the growing gaming literacy within large parts of the public has brought about the spontaneous emergence of resistance to gamification and purposive games in general. These practices, analysed here through the discussion of a series of theoretically linked vignettes, question and resist the cultural implications of all purposive approaches to play and games. Having addressed the perspectives mentioned above, the readers will then be engaged in a role-play activity, where they will be encouraged to engage critically with a particular game and to devise ways to subvert the constraining and purposive game elements from their intended purpose and toward true, free play. This will help participants to adopt an active role in engaging with the challenges and the contested politics that will characterise the \u2018Ludic Century\u2019."},

These schools are located in remote villages, away from urban amenities, and technological affordances and resources are limited. There are more than twenty culturally-diversed indigenous tribes in Borneo. Although it is a known fact that indigenous cultures, including those in Borneo, have many cultural protocols and distinctive custom practices, it is still a challenge for researchers who work with such communities to understand, adhere to and follow the cultural protocols. The model looks at incorporating gameplay and culture protocols to drive community engagement. Since play is universal, the creation of a trustworthy partnership between the community and researchers was established through the use of play during the engagement process.

Taking into account the relationship between play, technology and learning, the game design thinking approach fully embraces and accommodates for the creation and development of games of any typology (board games, card games, digital games, etc.) and playful solutions (gamified products) as freely chosen by the learners, aligning with the importance of autonomy, relatedness and purpose in motivating learners to be deeply engaged in the process. Through this process, learners are expected to gain valuable knowledge in creative and collaborative problem solving and experience game design and development process towards addressing real challenges and opportunities in their communities. The focus of the process is on the creative process rather than the end products/solutions produced by the learners. The paper will specifically discuss the methodology and findings from an experimental module developed based on the approach involving four cohorts of Level two undergraduate students (n=122, 2017-2019). The students came from the different schools and faculties at Coventry University, UK.

Hence, it is worth ensuring the design of game-based learning resources might support such blending, which can range from pragmatic considerations, such as how well an intended play session fits within a teaching schedule or homework arrangement, to pedagogical designs, which seek to address shortcomings in didactic instruction. To promote the sense of ownership and autonomy to break the barriers of adoption, not only that teachers should be part of the development process but they should also be empowered to create or co-create their games-removing the barriers to the development of game-based learning resources. In the CreativeCulture initiative, a project funded by the Newton Fund, teachers are empowered to create their games towards engaging learners with educational contents. Game making can be used to foster the development of transversal skills, such as 21st-century skills, where individuals can design and construct their games, often working in teams, allowing them to engage in a task that involves, and at the same time, fosters collaboration, problem solving and creativity. This case study extends the game design thinking process in proposing a solution for teachers in co-creating and developing their educational games. This process is examined through a study involving 43 teachers over two academic semesters. A total of eighteen game-based learning resources have been developed through the initiative, which has been tested in seven local primary schools in rural and semi-rural areas in Malaysia. This paper reflects on the lessons learnt and observations, which may provide insights on how game-based learning can remove barriers to the process of innovating the way we teach and learn."},

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson, utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. In this paper, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used to facilitate student self-reflection. A discussion of the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of n = 11 students undertaking the Dungeons & Dragons Self-Reflection Tool is presented alongside next stage pilot trials and considerations of future work."},

However, crowd-sensing data can offer much more, supplying a seemingly untapped font of information which may be used within the creation of unique PCG game spaces or content, whilst providing a visible outlet for the dissemination of crowd-sensed material to users. This paper examines one such use of crowd-sensed data, the creation of a game which will reside within the CROWD4ROADS (C4RS) [3] application, SmartRoadSense (SRS) [4]. The authors will open with a brief discussion of PCG. Following this, an explanation of the features and aims of the SRS application will be provided.

Taking into account the relationship between play, technology and learning, the design of the initiative itself fully embraces and accommodates for the creation and development of games of any typology (board games, card games, digital games, etc.)  and playful solutions (gamified products) as freely chosen by the participants, be them students or staff. By engaging in these practices, participants were intended to obtain valuable knowledge in creative and collaborative problem solving, experience game design and development process and even, possibly, address real challenges and opportunities in their communities. The focus however is on the creative process rather than the end products/solutions produced by the participants. The paper will specifically discuss the methodology and findings from an experimental module developed based on the approach involving level 2 undergraduate students (n=30) from the different schools and faculties at Coventry University, UK. Based on the qualitative feedback and reflections collected in week 5 and week 10 of the modules, the co-creative process inspired by play and games demonstrates that through the process, students discover the importance of elements such as empathy, purpose, meaning, art, creativity and teamwork in their learning regardless of the specific disciplines they are pursuing."},

In the same theoretical tradition, Gee (2016) and Kafai (2015) have suggested that games and game literacy constitute a particularly powerful and engaging path toward the social constructionist pedagogical perspective, where creative social interactions are scaffolded by a playful context in which learners can interact with self-directed purpose and heightened interest. Following these theoretical groundings, this paper presents findings and experiences in bringing game-based learning to two primary schools in two different remote rural locations in Sarawak, Malaysia, and articulates both the challenges and the opportunities that emerge when introducing this innovative approach in a context that is very different from the standard, Western, urban, tech-centred classroom that is the \u201cobject\u201d of most experimentations. Sharing similar (and, from a urban perspective, disadvantaged) socio-economic backgrounds, students at these schools were introduced to a variety of game-based learning materials (both digital and analog) which were designed in alignment with both the national curriculum for Science, Mathematics and English, and the cultural-technical specifics of their everyday living contexts. The paper discusses how context, intended contents and pedagogical approach informed the design, the deployment and the impact of these activities. The paper then moves to discuss the relevance of incorporating local values into the design of game-based learning for remote rural students, how games can enable critical and creative thinking to be encouraged in a playful social context, and the opportunity for students and teachers to become the designers of their own culturally informed game-based learning tools."},

These meaningful insights are essential for learners, allowing them to consider knowledge learned and apply relevant skills into different contexts and settings at a later date. Self-reflection allows students to develop their metacognition skills and work towards a practice that encourages continuous learning. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson (1974), utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/ written/ auditory/ narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. By remixing D&D with Self-Reflection and formative assessment principles, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used as a basis to develop lifelong learning skills. This paper presents the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of the Remixed D&D: Reflection and Assessment system.

Learning should be reshaped to better match these requirements and prepare learners for open societies where learning will be lifelong and based on critical-thinking, cultural awareness, flexibility and adaption to changes. This paper introduces a new approach developed under the scope of the Beaconing project, which aims to contextualise the teaching and learning process, connecting it with problem-based mechanics within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). The aim is to provide the missing connection between STEM subjects and real-world interactions and applications, and it is developed with inputs from teachers, researchers, educational experts and industry leaders. The pedagogical foundation is based on problem-based learning, in which active learning is in the centre and learners have to work with different tools and resources in order to solve problems (quests). Teachers facilitate, assess and author pervasive and gamified learning activities (missions). And these quests are gamified in order to provide non-linear game plots. This paper discusses the taxonomy for the Beaconing lesson path, which includes specific categories such as STEM competencies, learning objectives, pedagogical resources, rewards, narratives, game plots, location-based activities and game parameters. The lesson paths developed with the stakeholders will be populated with gamified learning activities such as mini-games, location-based mini-games, location-based activities and physical activities. The lesson paths will scaffold learners through self-directed and independent study, extending the learning experience beyond the classroom settings and complementing existing methods of teaching. The gamified lesson path taxonomy provides the backbone to the Beaconing platform and the associated components. This approach is adoptable and adaptable to various learning objectives."},

Through collaborations with its online digital companion, the ScreenWorks platform for peer-reviewed practice research in film and screen media, JMP has been a forerunner in championing and adopting the various multimodal forms practice-based and creative works can take within the context of an academic publication.[1] However, although media practice as a field and community embraces a plurality of media, the materiality of its scholarly forms of production and communication remain predominantly text-based. How then, should a journal of media practice extend from a speculative focus on what media practice as research could be, to an exploration of the alternative forms of communication and circulation it could enable?This special disrupted issue of the JMP has been conceptualised, edited and performed collectively by Coventry University\u2019s Centre for Disruptive Media (CDM) and the Disruptive Media Learning Lab (DMLL). Disruption, for us, should be seen as an affirmative practice, in the sense that it allows us to experiment with new forms of critique and to rethink and performatively disrupt some of academic publishing\u2019s core foundational concepts and practices, from the single author and the linear argument to the fixed and finalized text-object (for more on this alternative affirmative vision of disruption, see: Broekman et al. 2014; Hall 2016; J. Adema and Hall 2016). As editors, it was important to experiment with how media practice, in rethinking research as practice, could also be involved in disrupting the way we mediate this research through various formal and informal scholarly forms (including the academic journal).  As such we put forward a number of provocations with respect to what a \u2018journal of media practice\u2019 should or could be, to provide an alternative to the standard single-authored linear 8000-word journal article, that continues to dominate the field, as well as the Journal of Media Practice itself. What would experimental and interventionist forms of mediation and presentation in this respect look like for media practice? And how can JMP stimulate ongoing conversations `around these issues?  As such we wanted to explore three central questions in this special issue: How is media practice disruptive of and re-performing the way we do scholarly communication and education?How can JMP reconfigure (the politics of) its own practice?What should a disruptive \u2018journal\u2019 of media practice look / sound / feel like?"},

It will be argued that consideration must be given to where in the curriculum students should encounter COIL pedagogies and to how to synchronise and merge COIL within the wider course programme.

Therefore it is essential that students undertaking teacher education develop an ability to critically assess their own beliefs in relation to practice. The BMELTT (Blending MOOCs for English Language Teacher Training) project explores how the integration of an existing MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) into ELT programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, can impact on students\u2019 beliefs, while at the same time providing them with the opportunity to engage in reflection with a global community of practice. The participants were students on ELT programmes in the UK, the Netherlands and China, some were experienced teachers and some were new to teacher education. BMELTT involved reflecting on ELT themes in three ways: face-to-face in class; through a Virtual Exchange (VE) with the project partners; and with all the participants on the MOOC (around 40,000). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are no other research studies of this nature available, where a MOOC blend is used in conjunction with a VE to support the reflection on professional development in ELT. Another distinctive feature of BMELTT is that the action research cycle reported here was driven by an \u2018expert student\u2019, which enabled staff to see their practice from a novel perspective. The results illustrate that BMELTT stimulated a reflection on what it means to be an autonomous learner and an autonomous teacher in the digital age. It is hoped that these results can provide the ELT community with an innovative model of professional development. "},

Land, Meyer\nand Smith (2008, pp. ix-xxi) suggest that the identification of threshold concepts allows tutors to put in place targeted\ncurricular interventions aiming at transforming the students\u2019 learning experience, identifying troublesome knowledge and\nmaking such \u2018troublesome knowledge\u2019 less troublesome. The joint use of action research with threshold concept\npedagogy provides a unique opportunity for a constructivist staff/student exploration of the transformational challenges\nlearners face when they encounter troublesome knowledge.\nThe initial encounter of the author with threshold concept pedagogy was motivated by a drive towards helping first and\nsecond year undergraduate students reading English and Languages at Coventry University with their transformational\nlearning journey across the challenging terrain of difficult or alien knowledge. However, working closely with students on\ntroublesome linguistic knowledge brought into view the realisation that their insights would benefit other students more\nthan the lecturer. This resulted in the development of a new approach, where \u2018expert\u2019 undergraduate students are taking\nthe reins of the curricular research interventions to better understand why some of the peers struggle with the threshold\nconcepts identified previously in the field of linguistics (Lund, 2010) or even to explore new ones (Lee, 2011). The lecturers\ntherefore learn from their students\u2019 research into threshold concepts, in a role-reversal pedagogical model."},

Multilevel logistic regression models were developed to examine factors predictive of 5% weight loss.\n \n Results\n Most centers (n = 9) prescribed an 800- to 1000-kcal diet, but the duration and formulation of diet was variable. Overall, 30.6% (n = 510) of patients achieved 5% weight loss during the LRD.

In determining these grades, teachers were instructed to judge students\u2019 achievements in relation to the material that had been covered during Years 12 and 13 rather than against the complete A level syllabus. This small-scale study investigated potential impacts of the unusual experience of Year 13 A level mathematics students on factors including topics covered, confidence in mathematics, post-A level intentions and readiness for higher education, with a view to considering challenges around the transition to higher education. Data were gathered using student and teacher questionnaires. In total, 174 students and 27 teachers from 19 schools/colleges across the country (including one college in Wales) completed the questionnaires.

However, pre-operative dietary practices vary considerably and research to date has not examined the efficacy of a range of pre-operative diets within clinical practice. Thus, our study aimed to establish the variation in, and efficacy of, pre-operative dietary regimes utilised in practice across the UK.Methods:We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent a primary bariatric procedure at 16 participating UK bariatric centres between 1st January 2019 to 31st December 2019. Patient demographic data (gender, age, ethnicity), diabetes status and weight at baseline and on the day of surgery was collected. We also collected data about the pre-operative diet regimes, including kcals/day and duration. A multilevel linear random effects model was developed to examine predictors of weight on day of surgery. Baseline weight, diabetes status, diet duration and kcals/day were included in the model.Results:A total of 2,092 patients were included in the analysis. Diets ranged from <800kcal to >1200kcals/day and lasted one week to \u22655 weeks. The most common diets followed by patients were 800-1000kcals (55.7%) and lasted 2 weeks (71.4%). The unadjusted mean weight loss across all patients was 5.43kg (95% CI 5.18 to 5.68). Weight on the day of surgery was, on average, 0.79kg less for patients with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (p=0.002), and also less for 4 week (1.90kg, p=0.035) and \u22655 week diets (3.54kg, p=0.001), compared to a 1 week diet. Patients on a <800kcals/day diet were, on average, 8.86kg lighter than >1200 Kcals/day diets on the day of surgery (p=0.016). There was no significant difference in weight between VLED of <800kcal/day diets and LEDs of either 800-1000kcal/day (p=0.194) or 1000-1200kcal/day (p=0.212).Conclusions:A range of pre-operative diets are used in clinical practice in the UK, reflecting a need for standardised guidance in this area. Our study found that lower kcal and longer duration pre-operative diets were associated with greater pre-operative weight loss. Further research is required to confirm our findings that patients with diabetes respond better to pre-operative diets and to establish the adequate level of weight loss as proxy for liver shrinkage prior to bariatric surgery."},

However, there was no evidence of a difference in exam performance, class attendance or online engagement under the two teaching approaches. Perceptions of the flipped classroom differed according to gender, nationality and reported prior maths training, but the flipped classroom appears to enhance the student experience by making a traditionally difficult subject feel more accessible."},

It has rarely been compared between diagnoses or to controls. We investigated: whether AI differs between clinical cases and controls and between diagnoses; how different AI components are correlated; and whether AI is associated with functioning in clinical cases. Methods: Cases (N = 69) from psychiatric services had a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression or psychosis and were compared to primary care controls (N = 25). Participants completed the affective lability scale (ALS), affective intensity measure (AIM), affective control scale (ACS), scored mood fluctuation rate and the WHO-DAS. Results: There was a significant difference in affective lability between cases and controls and across diagnostic groups (p < 0.001). Compared to controls, cases showed lower affective control (p < 0.05). There were no differences in affective intensity between cases and controls or between diagnostic groups, or in mood fluctuation rate between groups. ALS score (p < 0.001), and total number of medications (p < 0.046), were associated with functioning, independent of diagnosis. Limitations: The sample size was modest. Cases were not in an acute illness episode and this could bias estimates of group difference towards the null. Conclusion: Individuals with mental disorder demonstrate higher levels of affective lability and lower affect control than those without mental disorder. In contrast affective intensity may not be useful in demarcating abnormal affective experience. Independent of diagnosis, affective instability, as measured by affect lability, adversely impacts day-to-day functioning. It could be an important target for clinical intervention."},

Although fortunately rare, mass casualty incidents involving children are possible which mandate reliable triage tools to determine the priority of treatment. Objective To determine the performance characteristics of five major incident triage tools amongst paediatric casualties who have sustained traumatic injuries. Design, setting, participants Retrospective observational cohort study using data from 31,292 patients aged less than 16 years who sustained a traumatic injury. Data were obtained from the UK Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database. Interventions Statistical evaluation of five triage tools (JumpSTART, START, CareFlight, Paediatric Triage Tape/Sieve and Triage Sort) to predict death or severe traumatic injury (injury severity score >15). Main outcome measures Performance characteristics of triage tools (sensitivity, specificity and level of agreement between triage tools) to identify patients at high risk of death or severe injury. Results Of the 31,292 cases, 1029 died (3.3%), 6842 (21.9%) had major trauma (defined by an injury severity score >15) and 14,711 (47%) were aged 8 years or younger. There was variation in the performance accuracy of the tools to predict major trauma or death (sensitivities ranging between 36.4 and 96.2%; specificities 66.0-89.8%). Performance characteristics varied with the age of the child. CareFlight had the best overall performance at predicting death, with the following sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) respectively: 95.3% (93.8-96.8) and 80.4% (80.0-80.9). JumpSTART was superior for the triaging of children under 8 years; sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) respectively: 86.3% (83.1-89.5) and 84.8% (84.2-85.5). The triage tools were generally better at identifying patients who would die than those with non-fatal severe injury. Conclusion This statistical evaluation has demonstrated variability in the accuracy of triage tools at predicting outcomes for children who sustain traumatic injuries. No single tool performed consistently well across all evaluated scenarios."},

The Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) is a well-known EWS used comprehensively in the United Kingdom. The HOTEL score (Hypotension, Oxygen saturation, Temperature, ECG abnormality, Loss of independence) was developed and tested in a European cohort; however, its validity is unknown in resource limited settings. This study compared the performance of both scores and suggested modifications to enhance accuracy. Methods: A prospective cohort study of adults (\u226518 yrs) admitted to medical wards at a Malawian hospital. Primary outcome was mortality within three days. Performance of MEWS and HOTEL were assessed using ROC analysis. Logistic regression analysis identified important predictors of mortality and from this a new score was defined. Results: Three-hundred-and-two patients were included. Fifty-one (16.9%) died within three days of admission. With a cut-point \u22652, the HOTEL score had sensitivity 70.6% (95% CI: 56.2 to 82.5) and specificity 59.4% (95% CI: 53.0 to 65.5), and was superior to MEWS (cut-point \u22655); sensitivity: 58.8% (95% CI: 44.2 to 72.4), specificity: 56.2% (95% CI: 49.8 to 62.4). The new score, dubbed TOTAL (Tachypnoea, Oxygen saturation, Temperature, Alert, Loss of independence), showed slight improvement with a cut-point \u22652; sensitivity 76.5% (95% CI: 62.5 to 87.2) and specificity 67.3% (95% CI: 61.1 to 73.1). Conclusion: Using an EWS generated in developed healthcare systems in resource limited settings results in loss of sensitivity and specificity. A score based on predictors of mortality specific to the Malawian population showed enhanced accuracy but not enough to warrant clinical use. Despite an assumption of common physiological responses, disease and population differences seem to strongly determine the performance of EWS. Local validation and impact assessment of these scores should precede their adoption in resource limited settings."},

Their potential to identify individuals at risk of clinical deterioration in the pre-hospital environment is unknown. This study compared the predictive accuracy of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) with current clinical practice. Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive adult (\u226516 yrs) emergency department attendances to a single centre over a two-month period. The outcome of interest was the occurrence or not of an adverse event within 24. h of admission. Hospital pre-alerting was used as a measure of current critical illness detection and its accuracy compared with MEWS scores calculated from pre-hospital observations. Results: 3504 patients were included in the study. 76 (2.5%) suffered an adverse event within 24. h of admission. Paramedics pre-alerted the hospital in 224 cases (7.3%). Clinical judgement demonstrated a sensitivity of 61.8% (95% CI 51.0-72.8%) with a specificity of 94.1% (95% CI 93.2-94.9%). MEWS was a good predictor of adverse outcomes and hence critical illness detection (AUC 0.799, 95% CI 0.738-0.856). Combination systems of MEWS and clinical judgement may be effective MEWS \u22654. +. clinical judgement: sensitivity 72.4% (95% CI 62.5-82.7%), specificity 84.8% (95% CI 83.52-86.1%).

The FCP tests animals of a single gender (usually females) at a number of fixed concentration levels in a sequential fashion. It begins with a sighting study that precedes the main FCP study and is used to determine the main study starting concentration. In this paper, we propose a modification to the sighting study and suggest that it should be conducted using both male and female animals, rather than just animals of a single gender. Statistical analysis demonstrates that, when females are more sensitive, the new procedure is likely to give the same classification as the original FCP, whereas, if males are more sensitive, the new procedure is much less likely to lead to incorrect classification into a less toxic category. If there is no difference in the LC50 for females and males, the new procedure is slightly more likely to classify into a more stringent class than the original FCP. Overall, these results show that the revised sighting study ensures gender differences in sensitivity do not significantly impact on the performance of the FCP, supporting its use as an alternative test method for assessing acute inhalation toxicity."},

Two new methods, the recently adopted acute toxic class method (ATC; OECD TG 436) and a proposed fixed concentration procedure (FCP), have recently been considered, but statistical evaluations of these methods did not investigate the influence of differential sensitivity between male and female rats on the outcomes. This paper presents an analysis of data from the assessment of acute inhalation toxicity for 56 substances. Statistically significant differences between the LC50 for males and females were found for 16 substances, with greater than 10-fold differences in the LC50 for two substances. The paper also reports a statistical evaluation of the three test methods in the presence of unanticipated gender differences. With TG 403, a gender difference leads to a slightly greater chance of under-classification. This is also the case for the ATC method, but more pronounced than for TG 403, with misclassification of nearly all substances from Globally Harmonised System (GHS) class 3 into class 4. As the FCP uses females only, if females are more sensitive, the classification is unchanged. If males are more sensitive, the procedure may lead to under-classification. Additional research on modification of the FCP is thus proposed."},

Overall compliance with CONSORT and STROBE guidelines in our study was 59% and 58% respectively, with very few papers fulfilling all criteria. In 37% of papers patient numbers were inadequately reported; 20% of papers introduced new statistical methods in the 'results' section not previously reported in the 'methods' section, and 23% of papers reported no measurement of error with the main outcome measure.

Since then there has been no systematic evaluation or documentation of their work at a national level. Recent national surveys of clinical ethics services in other countries have identified wide variation in practice and scope of activities. Objective: To describe the current provision of ethics support in the UK and its development since 2001. Method: A postal/electronic questionnaire survey administered to the chairs of all 82 clinical ethics services registered with the UK Clinical Ethics Network in July 2010. Results: Response rate was 62% with the majority of responding services situated in acute trusts. All services included a clinical ethics committee with one service also having a clinical ethicist. Lay members were present in 72% of responding committees. Individual case consultation has increased since 2001 with 29% of chairs spending more than 50% of their time on this. Access to and involvement in the process of case consultation is less for patients and families than for clinical staff. There is wide variation in committee processes and levels of institutional support. Over half of the responding committees undertook some form of evaluation. Conclusion: Clinical ethics services in the UK are increasing as is their involvement in case consultation. However, the significant variation in committee processes suggests that further qualitative research is needed to understand how these committees function and the role they play in their institution."},

UK television celebrity Jade Goody died from cervical cancer in 2009. We investigated the impact of her illness on media coverage of cervical cancer prevention, health information seeking behaviour and cervical screening coverage. Methods National UK newspaper articles containing the words 'Jade Goody' and 'cancer' were examined for public health messages. Google Insights for Search was used to quantify Internet searches as a measure of public health information seeking. Cervical screening coverage data were examined for temporal associations with this story. Results Of 1203 articles, 116 (9.6%) included a clear public health message. The majority highlighted screening (8.2%). Fewer articles provided advice about vaccination (3.0%), number of sexual partners (1.4%), smoking (0.6%) and condom use (0.4%). Key events were associated with increased Internet searches for 'cervical cancer' and 'smear test', although only weakly with searches for 'HPV'. Cervical screening coverage increased during this period. Conclusion Increased public interest in disease prevention can follow a celebrity diagnosis. Although media coverage sometimes included public health information, articles typically focused on secondary instead of primary prevention. There is further potential to maximize the public health benefit of future celebrity diagnoses."},

Breast and bowel cancer screening uptake levels were calculated and compared using the chi-squared test.\n\nResults\n72,566 women were invited to breast and bowel cancer screening after exclusions. Of these, 3,539 were South Asian and 69,027 non-Asian; 18,730 had been invited to mammography over the previous fifteen years (rounds 1 to 5). South Asian women were significantly less likely to undertake both breast and bowel cancer screening; 29.9% (n = 1,057) compared to 59.4% (n = 40,969) for non-Asians (p <0.001). Women in both groups who consistently chose to undertake breast cancer screening in rounds 1, 2 and 5 were more likely to complete round 1 bowel cancer screening. However, the likelihood of completion of bowel cancer screening was still significantly lower for South Asians; 49.5% vs. 82.3% for non-Asians, p <0.001. South Asian women who undertook breast cancer screening in only one round were no more likely to complete bowel cancer screening than those who decided against breast cancer screening in all three rounds. In contrast, similar women in the non-Asian population had an increased likelihood of completing the new bowel cancer screening test.

There is an emerging association between psoriasis, the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic disease. We hypothesized that ED occurs more commonly in patients with psoriasis, at least in part due to incipient atherosclerosis, which may offer an opportunity for early intervention. Objectives To determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, ED in patients with psoriasis in comparison with a heterogeneous dermatology outpatient control group. Methods We conducted a pilot study with a prospective observational cross-sectional design, recruiting consecutive adult male dermatology outpatients diagnosed with psoriasis or any other skin condition. Sexually active participants completed a questionnaire, a Dermatology Life Quality Index and the validated five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Results Fifty-three of 92 (58%) patients with psoriasis recorded an IIEF-5 score indicative of ED, compared with 64 of 130 (49%) control patients, reflecting an age-adjusted odds ratio of 2\u00c2\u00b7007 (95% confidence interval 1\u00c2\u00b7088-3\u00c2\u00b7701; P = 0\u00c2\u00b7026). A multivariable logistic regression model indicated that increasing age and hypertension, but not a diagnosis of psoriasis, were independent risk factors for ED in our study population. Conclusions We present the largest survey of ED in patients with skin disease, and the first to posit the potential link between psoriasis, ED and atherosclerosis. We suggest that an assessment of sexual function should be part of the routine holistic care provided for dermatology outpatients, and highlight the need to screen for cardiovascular risk factors in those with documented ED."},

The aim of this study was to establish if early identification of colonized patients using rapid methods alone reduces transmission. A prospective, cluster, two-period cross-over design was used. Seven surgical wards at a large hospital were allocated to two groups, and for the first 8 months four wards used rapid MRSA screening and three wards used a standard culture method. The groups were reversed for the second 8 months. Regardless of the method of detection, all patients were screened for nasal carriage on admission and then every 4 days. MRSA control measures remained constant. Results were analysed using a log linear Poisson regression model. A total of 12 682/13 952 patient ward episodes (PWE) were included in the study. Admission screening identified 453 (3.6%) MRSA-positive patient ward episodes, with a further 268 (2.2%) acquiring MRSA. After adjusting for other variables, rapid screening was shown to statistically reduce MRSA acquisition, with patients being 1.49 times (p 0.007) more likely to acquire MRSA in wards where they were screened using the culture method. Screening of surgical patients using rapid testing resulted in a statistically significant reduction in MRSA acquisition. This result was achieved in a routine surgical service with high bed occupancy and low availability of isolation rooms, making it applicable to the majority of health-care systems worldwide."},

Thus, the disparity reduced gradually over time, alongside an overall trend of increased uptake. However, figures remained consistently low for Muslims (51% in rounds 1 and 5). After adjusting for age, deprivation (and gender), bowel screening uptake remained significantly lower for all South Asian subgroups. After similar adjustments, breast screening uptake remained lower for all subgroups except Hindu-Gujaratis.\n\nFor Muslims registered with an Asian (vs. non-Asian) GP, bowel screening uptake was significantly lower (p <0.001). However, breast screening uptake for Muslims with an Asian (vs. non-Asian) GP showed no difference (p = 0.12) in the same period.\n\nColonoscopy and breast assessment uptakes were similar for both meta-categories, but Asian response time appeared slower for colonoscopy. The percentage of abnormal FOBT results was significantly higher for South Asian invitees. A slight increase in abnormal mammograms was observed for Muslims over time (2.7% to 4.2% in rounds 1 and 5 respectively).\n\nConclusion\nThe lower cancer screening uptakes observed for the South Asian population cannot be attributed to socio-economic, age or gender population differences. Although breast screening disparities have reduced over time, significant differences remain. We conclude that both programmes need to implement and assess interventions to reduce such differences."},

The pandemic was the spur of this process of repositioning. However, it is introduced as a generic approach, capable of application to other significant disruptions that affect fieldwork in real-time. The case study focus is an ethnographic fieldwork investigation halted due to the pandemic. It tracks the stages and processes that successfully moved the study online, delivering a virtual fieldwork investigation\u2014while retaining the initial research question and a sense of the ethnographic approach.The case study considers the destabilizing experience to the researcher and their mental well-being as a central concern. It begins by itemizing a to-do list of five steps to be able to relaunch the study. The first of the five steps uses three stages of critical thinking activities. Therefore, helping the researcher figure out in what direction the study can move forward. The three stages are the following: an evaluation of the study\u2019s positionality, a review of the purpose, and the priorities of the data collection.A reflective and iterative process is introduced as central to developing and implementing a reimagined method. The practicalities of two parallel processes are discussed; project management of the emerging virtual fieldwork plan and intertwined multiple iterations of resolving several practicalities demanded when using the new online approach.The virtual fieldwork was an evolving data collection method, requiring further reflective-iterative activities. Examples are discussed, including the recruitment of participants and the situational development of stronger narratives.Despite the threat to the researcher\u2019s mental well-being initially, a robust rethinking approach successfully moved a fieldwork program online."},

The EWL scale was originally developed to assess theoretically relevant aspects of the remote e-working experience related to four main areas: organisational trust, flexibility, work\u2013life interference and productivity. Design/methodology/approach: A number of changes were implemented to the scale (i.e. including new items, rewording of existing items) following a recent qualitative study conducted by the authors. The two studies outlined in this paper, conducted within discrete remote e-working populations, resulted in a validated and adjusted 20-item version of the scale. Findings: Study 1 performs confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on data from a sample of 399 remote e-workers (57.9% female) in UK to check the factor structure of the revised version of the EWL scale and the reliability of the posited dimensions. Results provided support for a 20-item scale, replicating the factorial structure of the original version. Study 2 tests and confirms the factorial structure of the final 20-item EWL scale in an independent sample of 366 remote e-workers (48.6% female) in UK. Study 2 provides further evidence of EWL scale's reliability and validity, with the four factors of the scale being significantly correlated with positive mental health, detachment from work and technostress. Originality/value: The EWL scale is a very timely and important tool which provides an overall framework of the key areas that are affecting remote e-workers\u2019 life; whose greater understanding may better prepare organisations to adapt work arrangements and introduce support policies and guidance."},

However, we have little understanding of their characteristics (e.g., demographic, psychological, individual, offense, and risk) and needs. To identify any similarities or differences that are unique to older individuals convicted of sexual offending, it is important to compare such characteristics across the adult lifespan. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to specify and synthesize the current knowledge of characteristics across the adult lifespan of the population of individuals convicted of sexual offenses. Five databases were searched and 10,680 results were screened, resulting in 100 studies included in the final review. The findings were grouped into four emergent themes: age of onset and prevalence; offender and offense characteristics; age and the risk of reoffending; and treatment.

In this chapter, we will examine the extent to which children's self-efficacy (academic, emotional and social) can be explained by individual differences in motivation, positivity and resilience and whether these patterns are influenced by the age and gender of pupils. We found that positivity and resilience contributed to the children\u2019s self-efficacy beliefs in all three domains, but there was a separation of contribution when we considered extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in relation to self-efficacy: specifically, intrinsic motivation contributed to the children\u2019s emotional and academic self-efficacy only, whereas extrinsic motivation contributed to social self-efficacy."},

In line with the implicit social-cognition models, we argue that the implicit moral disengagement would represent an unintentional, automatic, and less accessible form of the mechanisms bypassing the moral self-regulatory system. We anticipate that in situations implying on-the-spot decisions and where individuals might suffer no consequences for the misconduct, the implicit moral disengagement would predict the actual behavior while the explicit moral disengagement would predict self-reported conduct. The results of three empirical studies provide support for the theorization of an implicit moral disengagement and its assessment through a newly developed implicit measurement procedure using the relational responding task. Results of the structural equation models, including both implicit and explicit moral disengagement, demonstrated that only the implicit one was associated with the actual misconduct."},

Semi-structured interviews were framed within an existing theoretical of work-related well-being; hence, questions targeted five distinct dimensions of affective, professional, social, cognitive and psychosomatic well-being. However, data collection was not constrained by this model, allowing the exploration of other aspects interviewees considered relevant to their work-related well-being.

This has focussed attention on the need to identify the competencies employers and employees should train and develop to build digital resilience, enabling the benefits of remote working to be realised while mitigating potential risks. This contribution presents a multifaceted e-Work Self-Efficacy Scale, which supports a recently developed Digital Resilience Competency Framework (DRCF), assessing e-skills, trust building, self-care, remote social skills, and remote emotional self-efficacy beliefs. Data from 670 non-managerial employees (54.0% males) from a telecommunications company based in the Czech Republic were analysed, providing support for a bi-factor model. Latent Profile Analysis identified three clusters, characterised by different profiles: the Well-adjusted (with a reasonably good balance in engagement, satisfaction, and productivity), the Unhealthily dedicated (suffering some difficulties in setting boundaries), and the Distrustful self-shielding (the most compromised) remote workers. The results reinforce the importance of focusing on digital resilience competencies to promote sustainable, productive, engaging and healthy remote working. The e-Work Self-Efficacy Scale is a practical and effective organisational tool for managers and employees to use to assess and build digital resilience and sits alongside the Digital Resilience Competency Framework."},

Prevalence of perpetration and victimisation of controlling behaviours was relatively high, although the frequency and severity of the behaviours was mainly low level.  Five clusters were established based on the use of five types of controlling behaviours: economic, threatening, intimidating, emotional, and isolating.  Significant differences were found between the perpetration clusters and (i) minor physical assault, (ii) severe physical assault (iii) minor psychological aggression, and (iv) severe psychological aggression.  Furthermore, significant differences were found between the victimisation clusters and (i) physical assault, (ii) minor and (iii) severe psychological aggression.

Traditional MD is operationalised as a process operating across contexts, whereas online MD as a contextualised process related to online settings. We hypothesised that they are separate, although correlated, and have different roles depending on externalising tendencies. The sample comprised 856 high school students (mean age = 14.7, S.D. = 1.7; 45.6% females). Regression analyses highlighted that:  a) for low externalising adolescents, only online MD was significantly related to cyberbullying; b) for medium externalising adolescents, both online and traditional MD are significant, with the former more strongly associated with cyberbullying; c) for high externalising adolescents, traditional MD is key. Cluster analyses identified five configurations: 1) the Externalising Traditionally Disengaged; 2) the Externalising Not-Disengaged; 3) the Online Disengaged; 4) the All Good; and 5) the Unsuspected. The Online Disengaged has the highest engagement in cyberbullying. The Unsuspected (showing the same low externalising behaviour but significantly higher level of online MD than the All Good) engage in cyberbullying as much as Externalising Traditionally Disengaged and Not-Disengaged.These findings have implications for intervention programmes, underlining the relevance of considering the moral processeses within the online environment."},

The main goal of the present research is to investigate the effect of affective priming on prosocial orientation in natives and immigrants by using a mobile application. A quasi-experimental study has been conducted to test whether and how the manipulation of the priming, through positively and negatively connoted images, influences prosocial orientation.

Phenomenological configurations of bullying were identified considering not only exposure to and types of bullying, but also two of its main correlates: health problems and deviant behaviour. Moreover, the study examined how these configurations differ in terms of discrete negative emotions experienced in relation to work, coping strategies, and moral disengagement. Results from a sample of 1019 employee (53.6% women) support a 5-cluster solution: not bullied with no symptoms and no misbehaviour (39.9%); not bullied but with symptoms and some misbehaviour (23.9%); targets exposed to limited work-related negative acts, with no symptoms and some misbehaviour (22.3%); targets of work-related bullying with symptoms and misbehaviour (9.6%); and victims with high symptoms and high misbehaviour (4.4%). Moreover, the examination of clusters in relation to individual dimensions highlights the pivotal role of negative emotions and emotional regulation, independently from exposure to workplace bullying. Further, in more severe cases, moral disengagement and compensatory behaviour play an equally important role suggesting the weakening of individuals' behavioural regulation."},

This measure assesses a range of theoretically relevant aspects of the e-working experience related to four main areas: job effectiveness, relationship with the organisation, well-being and work-life balance. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents structured item development. Internal validity and reliability were tested on a sample of 260 e-workers (65 per cent female, age range 25\u201374). Correlations of the EWL scale with a measure of general health were tested on a subsample of 119 workers to provide initial evidence of construct validity. Findings: Exploratory factor analysis supported a 17-item scale assessing four factors: work-life interference, productivity, organisational trust and flexibility. Individual well-being was measured and a pattern of significant correlations against four factors as indicators of general health were found, including mental health and vitality. Research limitations/implications: A new sample would confirm the strength of the EWL scale alongside further tests of validity. Coping strategies related to the scale would aid mapping of individual competencies for remote e-working to promote e-workers\u2019 self-management, management style and organisational policy. Practical implications: The EWL scale helps organisations to evaluate and support the well-being of remote e-workers. It provides measurement on three levels: individual, supervisory and organisational, whereby practical strategies for improvement can be linked to the scale. Originality/value: The EWL scale completes a gap in the research by providing a measure aiding organisations to evaluate and support remote e-worker well-being."},

The current study assessed the factor structure and reliability of the revised Controlling Behaviour Scale (CBS-R) and the revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2).  Data were gathered from a U.K. general population sample (n = 405).  Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on the CTS2 and the CBS-R, for both perpetration and victimisation items, using the weighted least squares estimation with mean adjustment method.  Multiple factor models were confirmed in the analysis of the CBS-R and CTS-2 for perpetration and victimisation items.  Reliabilities for the factors were satisfactory across both scales.  This is the first validation of the factor structure of the CBS-R and the findings suggests that this a valid and reliable scale for measuring controlling behaviours.      "},

Results on a sample of more than 200 Italian university students show that the Amoral Manipulation facet of Machiavellianism, Academic Moral Disengagement, Deep Approach to Learning, and Normative Academic Cheating are significantly associated with Individual Academic Cheating. Moreover, results show a significant latent interaction effect between Normative Academic Cheating and Amoral Manipulation Machiavellianism: \u201camoral Machiavellians\u201d students are more prone to resort to Academic Cheating in contexts where Academic Cheating is adopted as a practice by their peers, while this effect is not significant in contexts where Academic Cheating is not normative.

In the organisational literature, it has been mainly assessed in relation to job tasks, leaving the emotional and interpersonal domains quite unexplored, despite their relevance. We aim to fill this gap by presenting a multidimensional work self-efficacy (W-SE) scale that assesses employees' perceived capability to manage tasks (task SE), negative emotions in stressful situations (negative emotional SE), and their conduct in social interactions, in terms of both defending their own point of view (assertive SE) and understanding others' states and needs (empathic SE). Results from two independent studies (Study 1, N\u202f=\u202f2192 employees; Study 2, N\u202f=\u202f700 employees) adopting both variable- and person-centred approaches support the validity of the scale. Findings of factor analyses suggest a bi-factor model positing a global W-SE factor and four specific W-SEs, which are invariant across gender and career stages. Multiple regressions show that global W-SE is associated with all considered criteria, task SE is associated positively with in-role behaviours and negatively with counterproductive behaviours; negative emotional SE is negatively associated with negative emotions and health-related symptoms; empathic SE is positively associated with extra-role behaviour; and, unexpectedly, assertive SE is positively associated with counterproductive work behaviour. However, results from a Latent Profile Analysis showed that the relationship between the SEs and criteria is complex, and that W-SE dimensions combine into different patterns, identifying four SE configurations associated with different levels of adjustment."},

Drawing on social-cognitive theory, in this study, we longitudinally examined the role of two opposite dimensions of the self-regulatory moral system, regulatory self-efficacy and moral disengagement, in influencing academic cheating behaviour. In addition, in line with the theories highlighting the bidirectional relationship between cognitive processes and behaviour, we aimed to also examine the reciprocal influence of behaviour on these dimensions over time. Overall, no previous studies have examined the longitudinal interplay between these variables. The sample included 866 (62.8% female) nursing students who were assessed three times annually from the beginning of their vocational education. The findings from a cross-lagged model confirmed that regulatory self-efficacy and moral disengagement have opposite influences on cheating behaviour, that regulatory self-efficacy negatively influences not only the engagement in misconduct but also the justification mechanisms that allow the divorce between moral standards and action, and that moral disengagement and cheating behaviour reciprocally support each other over time. Specifically, not only did moral disengagement influence cheating behaviour even when controlling for its prior levels, but also cheating behaviour affected moral disengagement one year later, controlling for its prior levels. These findings suggest that recourse to wrongdoing could gradually lead to further normalising this kind of behaviour and morally desensitising individuals to misconduct.\n\n"},

While workplace aggression has been frequently examined in relation to health problems, less is known about the possible negative impact such aggression may have on the (un)ethical behavior of victims. Our research aims to fill this gap. Drawing on literature on counterproductive work behavior (CWB) and the social-cognitive literature on aggression we investigated in two independent studies (NStudy1 = 439; NStudy2 = 416), the role of negative emotions \u2013 in particular anger, fear, and sadness, \u2013 and of moral disengagement (MD) in the paths between workplace aggression, CWB and health symptoms. The focus on these relationships is rooted in two reasons. First, misbehavior at work is a pervasive phenomenon worldwide and second, little research has been conducted in the healthcare sector on this type of behavior despite the potential importance of the issue in this context. We empirically tested our hypotheses considering a specific form of workplace aggression in each study: workplace bullying or third-party aggression. Results from the two empirical studies confirm the hypotheses that being target of workplace aggression (bullying or third-party aggression) is not only associated with health symptoms but also with misbehavior. In addition, the results of structural equation modeling attest the importance of examining specific discrete negative emotions and MD for better understanding misbehavior at work. In particular, this research shows for the first time that anger, fear, and sadness, generally aggregated into a single dimension, are indeed differently associated with MD, misbehavior and health symptoms. Specifically, in line with the literature on discrete emotions, while sadness is only associated with health symptoms, anger and fear are related to both health and misbehavior."},

The nature of these programs means there are often difficulties engaging and retaining clients, but authors have consistently found a strong therapeutic alliance is associated with client engagement. While research has focused on the association between the alliance and engagement, the factors that influence the therapeutic alliance have received less attention. Objective: To examine therapists\u2019 characteristics, namely therapists\u2019 stress and empathy levels, as potential predictors of client engagement and the therapeutic alliance, within an adolescent substance misuse group treatment program. Method: The sample included 84 adolescent clients and 14 therapists from a Secure Training Centre in England. Client engagement in the treatment program was observed, while self-reporting measures assessed the therapeutic alliance (client and therapist-rated), and therapists\u2019 stress and empathy levels. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that therapists\u2019 stress levels negatively influenced the therapeutic alliance and had a curvilinear relationship with client engagement, indicating that stress is not exclusively negatively related to engagement. Although stress was found to negatively impact both cognitive and affective empathy, neither cognitive nor affective empathy were significantly related to client engagement or the therapeutic alliance.Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of therapist characteristics on client engagement and the TA. Within practice stress can have a positive impact on clients\u2019 engagement. Nevertheless, therapists may need additional support to deal with stress effectively. Therapists\u2019 empathy may too be fundamental to client engagement, but only it if is perceived by clients."},

Results from a two-cohort sample (N = 1650) assessed at the beginning of their first year supported a 4-cluster solution: 1) Highly Self-Efficacious students, with high levels of self-efficacy in all domains; 2) Low Self-Efficacious students, with low levels of self-efficacy in all domains; 3) Learning and Socially Self-Efficacious students, with a medium-high level of self-regulated learning, medium level of social, and medium-low level of emotional self-efficacies; and 4) Emotionally Self-Efficacious students, with a medium-high level of emotional, medium-low level of social, and low level of self-regulated learning self-efficacies. The association of these configurations with wellbeing indicators, concurrently and one year later, provides support for the validity of the cluster solution. Specifically, by adopting the informative hypothesis testing approach, results showed that the first and second groups have the best and the worst wellbeing levels, respectively. Furthermore, whereas the other two groups did not differ with respect to depression, Learning and Socially Self-Efficacious students have higher life satisfaction than the last group.

The present study investigates the role of MD as a specific social-cognitive construct that, in the organizational context, may intervene in the process leading from stressors to counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Assuming the theoretical framework of the stressor-emotion model of CWB, we hypothesized that MD mediates, at least partially, the relation between negative emotions in reaction to perceived stressors and CWB by promoting or justifying aggressive responses to frustrating situations or events. In a sample of 1,147 Italian workers, we tested a structural equations model. The results support our hypothesis: the more workers experienced negative emotions in response to stressors, the more they morally disengaged and, in turn, enacted CWB."},

Although most adolescents act antisocial, a large part of them desist in adulthood and only a small percentage of individuals become chronically engaged in antisocial behavior (Moffit, 1993). Furthermore, a reduced but relevant group of individuals escalate in the severity of their aggression, transition to violence, and become engaged in serious forms of deviant behavior (Loeber and Hay, 1997; Tremblay, 2000). Over the years, many theories and research attested that the presence of several risky factors increase the probability that early aggressive conduct may become chronic or lead to violent outcomes. In particular, social cognitive theory has underlined the importance of studying the reciprocal relations between individual systems and social context to explain behavior and different developmental pathways. The present chapter focuses on two specific dimensions related to aggression that could operate in concert, amplifying and favoring onset, persistence, and aggravation of early conduct problems: moral disengagement and aggregation with deviant peers. Several findings have attested to the role of moral disengagement and aggregation with deviant peers in mediating the relation between early risk factors and later antisocial outcomes (Dishion and Nelson, 2007; Paciello, Fida, Tramontano, Lupenetti and Caprara, 2008). Overall, cross sectional and longitudinal studies have been alternatively focused only on one of these two well-known risk factors, leaving the interaction between them less explored. According to the social cognitive approach, we intend to underline how, at an individual level, moral disengagement mechanisms may legitimate a resort to behavior that may hurt other people (Bandura 1999; Bandura, Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli and Regalia, 2001), and how at inter-personal levels, aggregation with deviant peers increases the risk to engage in and maintain antisocial conduct by deviant friendship processes (Dishion and Nelson, 2007; Patterson, Dishion and Yoerger, 2000). Moreover, moral disengagement and aggregation with deviant peers could reinforce reciprocally during adolescent transition. In fact, on one hand, deviant peers may increase the recourse to moral disengagement mechanisms by social processes such as modeling and highly approving deviant conduct. On the other hand, moral disengagement may provide the cognitive framework within which deviant peer conduct appears appropriate and acquires legitimacy. We underline the need of further research and longitudinal studies focused on the study of dynamic relations between these social and cognitive factors to understand how to improve the efficacy of preventive interventions aimed at contrasting chronicization of antisocial conduct during adolescence."},

This study investigated the moderation role of irritability, a specific aggression-related disposition, in the process of work stressors that are conducive to counterproductive work behaviour (CWB) within the stressor\u2013emotion model. From a total sample of 1147 Italian workers (53.5% women), high- and low-irritability groups were identified. Then, using a multigroup structural equations model, we simultaneously examined all the relations in both high- and low-irritability groups, and investigated whether these relations were different between them. Results showed that job stressors elicited negative emotions that, in turn, lead to CWB. Moreover, some job stressors influenced CWB directly only in the high-irritability group. Overall, irritability moderated the relation among job stressors and CWB but not the relation among job stressors and negative emotions, with the sole exception of role conflict. As well, irritability did not moderate the relation between emotion and CWB. Thus, high-irritability employees may be more prone to react aggressively to job stressors via multiple functioning paths. The principal differences between low- and high-irritability individuals could be how they manage the impact of perceived stressors on emotions and behaviour."},

Cultural self-efficacy (CSE) was defined as person's perception of his/her own capability to function effectively in situations characterized by cultural diversity. On the basis of Bandura's guideline for the development of a domain-specific self-efficacy measure, we tailored 50 items after reviewing literature about cultural competence, adolescents' school-problems and social self-efficacy scales developed in previous studies in intercultural contexts. After pre-testing and analyzing psychometric properties of the scale, we selected 33 items. Eight hundred sixty-eight adolescents with five different cultural origins completed a set of questionnaires, including the CSES-A, internal control expectancies, general self-efficacy, academic expectancies, number of people from diverse cultures they keep in touch with, acculturation attitudes, perceived enrichment of other cultures, acculturation stress and demographic data. An EFA with MPLUS 2.14 highlighted a five-factor solution with 25 items that was supported by a subsequent CFA. The five factors were: self-efficacy in mixing satisfactorily with other cultures, in understanding different ways of life, in processing information from other cultures, in coping with loneliness and in learning and understanding other languages. The pattern of correlation with internal control expectancies, general self-efficacy and cultural variables supported the validity of the scale. CSES-A may be useful for future research on multicultural contexts, in which self-efficacy in cultural adaptation could be a fundamental variable."},

However, in most countries with less resourced occupational therapists like Ghana, education in occupational therapy is fraught with inadequate number of same professionals to mentor undergraduate occupational therapy students. The students are thus faced with serious dilemma regarding their professional identity which tends to elicit a bleak perception of their chosen career. The present study was therefore envisaged to interpret and analyse the students' lived experiences, with the view to capture the process of constructing and developing professional identity. The study focused on purposively sampled group of nine undergraduate occupational therapy students during their practice placement education, and their learning styles on didactic lectures. A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was adopted for the study. The students were followed up throughout their four-year study program for data collection, using one-to-one semi-structured interviews each year. With reference to the threshold concepts, transcribed interview data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological procedures.

It is evident that conducting qualitative research in the Arab world is a new and emerging trend which is required not least to question the legitimacy and utility of the inherited system of higher education prevalent in Palestine (Abu Lughod, 2000). It is clear ANNU is working hard to strengthen its research reputation and serve as an education leader not only locally to meet community needs in sustainable economic, technical, and human development, but also globally.My collaboration with Saida at ANNU was initiated through our rich partnership work on OpenMed an Erasmus+ project (2015-2018) with a Consortium of 13 partners across Europe and the South-Mediterranean (S-M). OpenMed focused on the adoption and piloting of open educational practices and open educational resources in S-M countries as a bottom-up approach to support the modernisation, accessibility, and internationalization of HEIs. Additionally, along with Professor Daniel Burgos, from the Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, also a partner in OpenMed, we have been Visiting Professors at ANNU, engaging in the doctorate study summer schools, as well as being facilitators on the PhD programme in Education.Building on OpenMed\u2019s cooperative agreements between partner universities in sharing practices and resources, a recent focus Saida initiated with myself and colleagues at Coventry has been on raising the awareness of and confidence in qualitative research practices (especially master\u2019s and doctoral students\u2019 as the next generation of academics and researchers). Importantly, in understanding more personalised perspectives from students and faculty about ANNU teaching and learning practices, together we have sought to understand each-other\u2019s contexts, current priorities, and future goals, and adapted our project work accordingly. We adopted an Action Research methodology for our South-North qualitative teacher-researcher development as a social practice and used cycles of interpretation and negotiation (rather than a focus on top-down research quality enhancement). As Action Research involves deconstructing, interrogation, and de-centring through cycles of planning, acting, observing, and reflecting (Carr & Kemmis, 1986), during our workshops opportunities, and online meetings, we have questioned and re-examined western researcher-development practices between our two institutions to establish a process of joint, intercultural meaning-making and knowledge production. Alongside the values as participants of holding ourselves accountable, our Action Research process also sought to develop ourselves as South-North teacher-researcher-participants, not only as active practitioners in the field but also reflective professionals (see Kember et al., 2019). The outcome being that as South-North teacher-researcher-participants we would \u2018own\u2019 a clearer rationale for our practices, based upon our own professional observations, deliberations, and experiences, as an embedded process. Time was also devoted in the workshops to writing for publication, with my colleague in GLEA, Dr Dimitar Angelov, joining as a UK Academic Writing Expert, also committed to Action Research as a Global South-North learning partnership. The desire to learn together and improve stimulated both facilitators and participants to go beyond their pre-conceived, and often culturally determined ideas about research and academic staff development practices. Whilst we navigated challenges in language and translation of concepts at times, the cross-pollination of perspectives and experiences was very powerful, and the success of the programme was undoubtedly due to the unflagging motivation of everybody involved. A research paper (Affouneh et al., 2021), detailing our Global South-North learning partnership is in preparation, and we look forward to continuing our collaborative efforts especially with regards to working with colleagues in the Research and Writing Support Unit at ANNU, that has come together as a result of our programme.

This mixed methods research shares the findings of both questionnaires (1,008) and follow-up interviews (34) from students enrolled on an EAP course at a Chinese university to explore students\u2019 perceptions and experiences of translanguaging in EAP. Drawing on the concepts of translanguaging and co-learning, the paper reveals that the different translanguaging practices used by the teachers and students (as reported by students) in the EAP classroom helped to enhance student understanding and learning, classroom communication and motivation for learning. However, potential drawbacks are also noted, e.g., in how translanguaging is not conducive for creating a pure English learning environment and can reinforce some students\u2019 over-reliance on Chinese. The findings yield important implications for more careful and intentional pedagogical translanguaging design in EAP curriculum planning in China and beyond. "},

Detailed plans for 2020 were discussed including a series of site visits and face-to-face training. However, the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the plans in ways that could not have been foreseen and new ways of thinking and doing came to the fore. Writing from an insider perspective as project partners, in this paper we draw from appreciative inquiry, using a metaphor of a mosaic as our identity, to first provide the background on the iKudu project before sharing the impact of the pandemic on the project\u2019s adapted approach. We then discuss how alongside the focus of iKudu in the delivery of an internationalised and transformed curriculum using COIL, we have, by our very approach as project partners, adopted the principles of COIL exchange. A positive impact of the pandemic was that COIL offered a consciousness raising activity, which we suggest could be used more broadly in order to help academics think about international research practice partnerships, and, as in our situation, how internationalised and decolonised curriculum practices might be approached."},

This study aimed to analyze the level of social resilience of students in early education and basic education during the COVID-19 pandemic and how social structures affect the level of resilience. The research methods used were qualitative and quantitative approaches. A survey was conducted on 115 respondents. Students resilience was measured by the NMRQ Questionnaire (Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire) and the factors affecting resistance were measured by the SAJA Questionnaire. From the qualitative approach, the study found that the level of social resilience of students was quite high due to the application of the ACES-based environmental and fun learning model using lego, makey-makey, masks, and music. From the quantitative approach, most students could build resilience and change their perceptions from difficult conditions to pleasant learning conditions due to social and economic factors. The factor that most influences the level of social resilience of primary school early childhood was the family socioeconomic factor."},

The project is focused on how universities from the designated countries, and other S-M countries, can join the action as community partners in the adoption of strategies and channels that embrace the principles of openness and reusability within the context of higher education. The project teams' interpretation of OEP emphasises the idea of breaking boundaries and building bridges that expand the opportunities for any citizen to benefit from universities as a source of knowledge without having to become fee-paying students. In addition, apart from the creation and use of content, open pedagogic approaches that place \"an emphasis in the network and the learner's connections within this,\" (Weller, 2014) are key to OpenMed's definition for Open Education Practices.  However, whilst OpenMed seeks as an aspirational goal that, as part of their service mission, higher education professionals and institutions engage in the creation and use of educational resources that fully fit UNESCO's definition, the OpenMed partners also acknowledge that the uptake of Open Education Practices may also start with less ambitious goals, for example, by making copyrighted content publicly available on the Internet.In this chapter, the authors will present on the findings to date from across the three main project phases which include; review of Open Education Initiatives; Widening Participation in Open Education Practices; and, Capacity Building Opportunities for Lecturers and other Higher Education Professionals. In particular, the authors will consider how OpenMed is striving to nurture a culture of openness across the partner higher education institutions and neighbouring communities in both a top-down and bottom-up approach. The top-down governing systems of universities in S-M countries is one of the key factors viewed as hindering engagement with Open Education Practices at institutions within the region. Favouring a bottom-up approach, OpenMed aims to ensure that the Mediterranean university systems are better integrated into global academic and scientific cooperation networks, which is an essential factor in the integration of Mediterranean communities and economies (Scalisi, 2016 p.17/18).

That earlier study is rooted in Sanderson (2008) and his argument that internationalisation of higher education requires the internationalisation of the academic self and follows up on Vandeyar (2019), who argues that academics need to decolonise first in order to be able to decolonise curricula in South Africa. We, five expert practitioners and researchers in curriculum development and internationalisation of higher education became curious about the state of our own decolonised selves as. In the original study, we decided to adopt an autoethnographic approach to data collection (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007). Autoethnography is a means of reflecting on the self so as to reveal true feelings and vulnerabilities that may otherwise lie hidden, not just from others, but from oneself (King, 2013). Autoethnography is particularly pertinent in the current context because it \"lies at the intersection of discourses and experiences of Self and Other, Insider and Outsider, Native and Colonialist\" (Anderson & Glass-Coffin, 2013). Each member of the team created a visualization of their decolonising self in the form of the 'map' of an island, following King (2013). Each map was complemented with a reflexive commentary. These two qualitative moves enabled each individual to explore their standpoint regarding their professional context and practices concerning decolonization. Subsequently, we shared our images and our commentaries, and collaboratively explored them. The comparative analysis of our 'islands' includes a discussion to what extent internationalisation of the curriculum (Leask, 2015) and internationalisation at home (Beelen & Jones, 2015) are different from decolonisation of the curriculum. The current paper is a reiteration of the earlier study, but the five western European 'islands' are compared and contrasted here with five 'islands' from South Africa, drawn by curriculum developers and researcher. The identities of the ten professionals are compared and analysed in the framework of the 'third space', specifically Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) between South African and European students. Such forms of collaboration form the core of the Erasmus+ Project iKudu and are usually associated with internationalisation but not with decolonisation. In this paper we explore the potential of online teaching and learning practices for decolonisation of curricula. The names of the South African authors will be added later. During the presentation, participants will be able to draw their own version of their professional 'islands'."},

As part of the project, these universities were asked to assess how online collaboration contributes to achieving their aims for internationalised curricula, using Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider, Whitney & Stavros, 2008). We will present the five South African self-assessments but also a comparison with self-assessments of the European project partners. The South African self-assessments were followed up by on line interviews with stakeholders, as an alternative for the originally planned site visits. We will present the expectations of stakeholders on the contribution of COIL practices to transformation of curricula, as outlined in Policy framework for internationalisation of higher education in South Africa (2017). Conceptualising the iKudu project enables us to define our focus on COIL. Extrapolating the role of COIL as a subtool for internationalisation of formal home curricula requires appreciation of the integration of existing curriculum transformation initiatives across the SA and European partners to discover the best of what exists. This includes awareness of strategies focused on curriculum decolonisation with focus on the roles of strategic leadership, COIL practitioners, and its impact on student/graduate experience - and to dream of what might be. Finally, it will also allow us to reflect on the value of Appreciative Inquiry in a South-North project."},

It will be argued that consideration must be given to where in the curriculum students should encounter COIL pedagogies and to how to synchronise and merge COIL within the wider course programme. This is to enable students to make sense of COIL as part of their wider internationalised curriculum and not to see it as an add on.

For example, universities are experiencing an increase in their recruitment of international students (Beech 2018; Borjesson, 2017; Fliegler, 2014); online international learning is increasingly becoming a core pillar of university collaborations for globally networked learning (Villar-Onrubia & Rajpal, 2016; Redden, 2014; Bell, 2016); and open courses such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) target learners, regardless of their geographic and cultural background (Maringe & Sing, 2014; Brahimi & Sarirete, 2015; Affouneh, Wimpenny, Ra\u2019Fat Ghodieh et al., 2018). \nIn countries like Jordan that, due to their demographic and socioeconomic context, are experiencing a massification phenomenon with respect to learners accessing higher education (HE), responsive, effective education processes are required to maintain quality learning experiences (Affouneh & Amin Awad Raba 2017; Foley & Massingila, 2014; Dian-Fu & Yeh, 2012).\nThis paper presents the activities and the findings of ongoing the JOVITAL project in its goal of building the capacity of Jordanian educational technologies. \nJOVITAL is an international cooperation project co-funded by the Erasmus + Capacity Building in HE programmes of the European Union during the period October 2017 - 2020 involving four European institutions and five Jordanian universities. The aim of JOVITAL is to foster academic exchange using virtual mobility in order to offer learning opportunities to academic staff, university students and disadvantaged learners in Jordan.\n"},

Our paper outlines how new and emerging technologies are being innovatively used in institutions around the world and on this basis, how they are being adapted and implemented in Jordan as part of JOVITAL. Regulations and instructions on an institutional and national level have been continuously changing over the years, with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) approving the blended model within 25% of programmes, placing a cap on the amount of online learning that take place within a HE programme. However, an alliance of three or more Jordanian universities can establish a fully online programme as well. That being said, MOHESR has expressed some constraints regarding quality assurance including the way exams are conducted, how learning outcomes are measured and how course funding and cultural perceptions are considered. Challenges in the open education methodology, therefore, still exist in the academic medium in Jordan, where three main issues are of particular note: The governmental policies instructed by Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; the alignment of these policies with regulations published by Jordanian accreditation institutes; and the cultural acceptability of open education and distance learning in general. The ideas we present here include applications of technology for domestic online learning, as well as global partnerships that support the development of intercultural competencies through the use of Virtual Collaborative Learning (VCL) or Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL).

This has important implications for teaching and learning processes, for example through participatory cultures and open educational practices. The potential benefits of this include opportunities for informal and peer-to-peer learning, a new attitude toward intellectual property, diversification of cultural expression, a betterdialogue around skills valued in the workplace, and a more proactive conception of citizenship. However, to fully enjoy these benefits, a number of challenges need to be overcome, including unequal opportunities for participation, low media literacy and ethical issues (Jenkins et al. 2015). To address these challenges, it is essential to carefully reconsider the knowledge, skills and attitudes that must be at the core ofcontemporary learning experiences and, based on that, expand the key attributes that educators should possess in order to meaningfully support learners \u2013 across all age groups \u2013 in becoming competent professionals and engaged citizens in a networked world. Therefore, it is crucial for institutions and governments to understand howto better design professional development opportunities and capacity building programmes for academics at various career stages. A number of generic frameworks redefining the idea of literacy in a digital world have emerged over the last few years out of different disciplines, schools of thought and professional sectors (Ala-Mukta 2011). As a consequence, the range of competences, levels of proficiency, scope and terminology is extremely varied. More specifically, some proposals have attempted to identify the attributes and qualities that are particularly relevant to academics at various levels (Redecker 2017, UNESCO 2011). Ultimately what is at stake is the (re)definition of what it means to be an educator in the context of contemporary educational institutions, what students need to learn and how they can best learn in contemporary networked societies."},

The project is structured in three phases: 1) review of Open Education initiatives, 2) widening participation in OEP and 3) capacity building opportunities for lecturers and other HE professionals. In this paper, we will share our learning from phase three, which involved the pilot run of a course \"Open Education: fundamentals and approaches\". In particular, we will focus on how facilitators, working within the eight partner universities in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Palestine, engaged with 70 lecturers and other HE professionals, collaborating in local Learning Circles (https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/), with a focus on capacity building in the adoption of OEP and engagement with OER. The pilot course represents one of the first attempts to build capacity with university staff in the field of open education in the Mediterranean region, and has been designed, developed and piloted collaboratively among the institutions involved from Europe and the South-Mediterranean region. We will present an overview of the five course modules, and the pedagogical approach adopted, underpinned by Fink's (2003) integrated approach to course design; a taxonomy which goes beyond rote learning, or straightforward application of skills, towards the development of creative, engaging, reflective learning experiences as both process and outcome. The central tenet of Fink's approach is that course design needs to incorporate significant learning goals rather than purely content-driven methods, with an emphasis on active learning, encouraging the application of course content to real-life problems and having good systems in place for social interaction, feedback and assessment (Fink, 2003). In sharing the facilitators' perspectives, we draw on the analysis of data captured pre-and post the pilot course including mixed method data from online surveys and semi structured interviews. Question areas were adapted from the European Digital Competence Framework for Educators (DigCompEdu) and considered the learning environment, organisational, pedagogical and digital skills required to effectively engage and empower learners with the course content, including facilitators perspectives on what are seen to be core attitudes and beliefs necessary for facilitating intercultural exchange. In addition, we will share how the facilitators went about the assessment of the university staffs' Final Project Work, and how the moderation and quality processes piloted were both facilitated and experienced. In seeking the perspectives of the facilitators' across the eight universities, complemented with data from the course platform (Sakai) using learning analytics, we will present the findings in ways which highlights the comparative practices of the different facilitators and their Learning Circles across the partner regions."},

Objective: This qualitative research synthesis profiles, integrates and re-presents qualitative research focused on the ways music therapists and clients engage in, and make meaning from, clinical improvisation. Further, as a conduit for broadening dialogues, opening up this landscape fully, and sharing our response to the analysis and interpretation process, we present an arts-informed re-presentation of this synthesis. Methods: Following an eight step methodological sequence, thirteen qualitative studies were synthesized. This included reciprocal and refutational processes associated with synthesizing the primary studies, and additional steps associated with an arts-informed representation.  Findings: Three themes, professional artistry, performing self, and meaning making, are presented.  Each theme is explored and exemplified through the selected articles, and discussed within a larger theoretical framework. An artistic re-presentation of the data is also presented.Conclusions: Music therapists use complex frameworks through which to engage clients in, and make meaning from, improvisational experiences. Artistic representation of the findings offers an added dimension to the synthesis process, challenging our understanding of representation, and thereby advancing synthesis methodology. "},

This is largely at odds within contemporary fields of educational practice, where emphasis is centred on innovative and co-creative pedagogies, that allow for curiosity-led learning, creative practical activities and reflective spaces. This disjointed relationship between expectations and practice, provides the innovative educator with a greater challenge in designing ways to engage with learners in creative and experimental practices, whilst managing the perceived risk and uncertainty for the institution, educator and student. \nThis paper presents two studies that were delivered at Coventry University, UK, to explore the use of creative and playful pedagogies within a higher education setting. The first study, Curious Oddities, involved students from Motor Sports and Health, working with a local artist during induction week, to create weird and wonderful 3D sculptures of creatures which represent their inner selves. In the process the students, using materials, scratch-built, from found objects, explored intimate detail around their hopes and fears to provoke and evoke their responses about their perspectives on their learning journey ahead. The workshops were offered as a means for realising self-learning, connection, as well as the animation of difference. \nIn the second study, Sports & Exercise post-graduate students were tasked with undertaking a gamified, problem-based learning task, delivered via a single module blended approach. Four mystery packages were delivered over the course of four weeks to each student group of 4 (n = 6 groups), containing body composition data, nutrition-based props, usbs with videos and fictional materials related to the task. Students were asked to analyse the data received and to reflect on all of the materials to construct a needs analysis for a fictional client. \nThe authors will briefly present each study and the key findings, reflecting upon issues that arose, particularly in the challenges of managing uncertainty, confusion and perceived risk from the perspectives of the staff and students involved. \nA mystery package will be used within the presentation to promote creative discussion on ways to effectively employ creative and playful pedagogies in University settings. We will discuss resource and confidence issues in implementing creative pedagogy (and with large cohorts) and engage with the conference attendees in how to generate ideas for actively-engaged, inter-disciplinary learning, willing to take risks. \n\n"},

Lecturers need special skills to appreciate / understand which educational, cultural and language related processes are at work in on line collaboration virtual exchange between students. How do lecturers collaborate to facilitate online interactions between students? Which forms of training for designing and facilitating virtual student exchange have been found effective?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The idea of providing students, lecturers, researchers and non-academic staff members with opportunities to travel abroad and spend time \u2013 from just days to whole academic years \u2013 at other institutions has arguably been the dominant approach to date in internationalisation strategies and policies in the education sector. As a mechanism for Internationalisation of the Curriculum (IoC), international mobility is expected to help students develop valuable competences and attributes (e.g. to support graduate employability and global citizenship) after being exposed to different pedagogical practices, collaborating and building relationships with peers from dissimilar backgrounds and, more generally, living in unfamiliar socio-cultural contexts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the last two decades, the possibility of embedding opportunities into the curriculum for virtual exchange between students based at different countries has attracted the interest of educators, institutional leaders and policy-makers as another possible approach to internationalising the curriculum. Whereas mobility is being considered as the gold standard for IoC, in most institutions the proportion of students engaging in these kinds of international experiences is considerably smaller than those who do not do so. Universities need to adopt policies and practices to ensure they are not disadvantaging students, for whom international mobility is less feasible due to, for example, financial constraints or carer responsibilities. In addition, it is imperative that the higher education (HE) sector adapts to accommodate the diverse needs of disabled students. Virtual student exchanges offer the promise of a more equitable and inclusive approach to IoC, which could play a key role within a broader mix of Internationalisation at Home (IaH) initiatives aimed at benefiting all students, not just the travelling elite. Likewise, they can provide students with scenarios akin to those they are likely to face in their future professional lives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order for the potential of virtual exchanges to be realised, it is essential to address important challenges and build evidence-based knowledge on suitable pedagogical models, infrastructures, discipline-specific needs and the actual impact of such learning experiences on student development. One of the most crucial aspects relates to the capabilities that academics need to have in order to be able to successfully design and deliver learning activities aimed at internationalising the curriculum through student online cross-institutional interactions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This paper shares some preliminary analysis of data collected from examples of virtual exchange evaluated at Coventry University and presents a research design that could help shed light on the key attributes that academics facilitating virtual exchanges need to have and how institutions can build that capacity. The proposed study aims to generate findings that could be relevant for theory-building purposes \u2013 in both the field of IoC and educational technology \u2013 as well as have important practical implications for institutions wanting to support their staff by means of academic development opportunities and other mechanisms.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"},

Therefore, as the population ages, the sectors for health and social care will have to re-examine existing models of health and care delivery and adjust them to the needs of the individual (i.e. patient, carer). In other\nwords, further to traditional health organisations, other organisations and sectors could be approached as partners in public health research. This paper puts forward the idea that one such potential partner is the cultural sector, and specifically theatre organisations. Research shows that engaging with theatre and the arts can enable people to gain awareness of their strengths, increase social networks, develop creative and personal skills - especially skills in\nmovement and non-verbal forms of communication - and enhance their health and well-being (Savin Baden et al., 2013; Wimpenny & Savin Baden, 2014). A growing body of recent research shows that participation in performance arts activities within a community theatre context serves to promote both socio-cultural integration and wellbeing in people with dementia (Dupuis et al., 2016;\nZeilig et al., 2016). Drawing on this, this paper presents the Arts Gymnasium project, which uses theatre and drama activities to contribute to the quality of life and positive well-being of people aged 50+ living in Coventry. The project is work in partnership between The Belgrade Theatre, the Age UK Coventry and the Coventry University. The paper reports an evaluation of Year 1 of a drama for health programme for people 50+ that is taking place at the Belgrade Theatre Coventry in 2016-2017. It places attention to a particular strand of the programme being tailored to meet the needs of people living with memory impairments and/ or early stage dementia. By examining this strand, the purpose of the paper is to show (1) how does the theatre and drama activities may yield new insights into supporting a person with dementia; and\n(2) dow do people with dementia and their carers experience the significance of the theatre to their own lives? The underlying assumption is that the drama activities appeal to the participants\u2019 creativity and imagination and, in doing so, could stimulate cognitive and communication functions, and at the same time reduce their feelings of isolation and depression. Evidence collected during the sessions by the participants and project staff will be provided and\nfocuses on the participants\u2019 experience when engaged with drama activities. Qualitative and quantitative data will be presented; focus group interviews with the participants, health and wellbeing scales (e.g. WEMWBS), along with video data from the sessions. Essentially the paper contributes to the growing arts and health field by providing new methods for engaging some of the\nmost vulnerable communities and tests drama practices as a way of achieving health and wellbeing outcomes for the 50+ community, with impact on the wider community and professional practice.\n\nReferences\nDupuis, S.L., Kontos, P., Mitchell, G., Jonas-Simpson, C. & Gray, J.

This was a two-year project funded by EU Tempus, involving partnership between four European (EU), one Egyptian and two Moroccan higher education (HE) institutions. The overarching aim of the project was to bring together partner expertise to share best practice to support students with disabilities in accessing and optimizing their chance of succeeding in HE through the use of assistive technologies (AT). Research illustrates that there is still much work to be done in levelling higher education experiences for disabled students (Vickerman & Blundell, 2010). \n\nThe project team investigated the current state of accessibility for disabled people in the EU and the partner countries in terms of national and international legislation, HE policy and practice. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (WHO, 2001) was adopted which is the WHO's framework for health and disability that emphasises health and functioning, rather than disability. This conception of disability when applied in an HE context suggests the need to focus holistically on the education experience in its widest sense, thus enabling students to enjoy the full benefits of involvement in student life. \n\nAn appreciative inquiry approach was adopted in line with a collaborative action research style ethos. The project aimed to capture the perspectives and alter attitudes and practice at all levels including students, academic and administrative staff, technical experts and senior managers. Having provoked change there is commitment in the partner countries to sustaining and building on what has been achieved. Partners are keen to disseminate the project outcomes nationally and internationally, and to become flagship institutions within their own countries. Mutual benefit for the EU universities has been felt through challenging taken-for-granted practice that might have lulled universities into thinking they had levelled the field for students with disabilities. For instance, the use of IT and AT had not been optimised in our own institution prior to this project, throwing local challenges into sharp relief."},

Within the project, universities from across the two shores of the Mediterranean, representing different levels of maturity in the implementation of OEPs, are working together to foster new forms of international partnership and exchange across disciplines and faculties. The first phase of the project has involved the gathering and analyzing of international case studies representing initiatives in OEP with a focus on the South-Mediterranean (S-M) region, to generate a Compendium of reliable, evidence-based knowledge. This will inform the subsequent phases of the project and ultimately aim to facilitate the adoption of OEP at the partners in the S-M region, other universities in each of their respective countries and, more broadly, at other universities in the Arab World. Key findings from this first phase of the project have highlighted a spectrum of processes, procedures and technological choices in the range of case study examples developed.

A total of 215 final year occupational therapy students\u2019 engagement in an on-line discussion forum was analysed using case study design. The study revealed significant increases in inter-cultural sensitivity amongst students measured pre and post project, alongside numerous challenges in engagement and learning. Augmented learning opportunities within the curriculum are argued as vital to equip graduates with enhanced agency, greater resilience and improved tolerance for managing complexity. Further research is required to enable graduates to be better prepared for practice and to develop skills to help navigate and mange the \u2018not knowing\u2019.Publisher Statement:\u00a0This is an Accepted\nManuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in World Federation\nof Occupational Therapists (WFOT) Bulletin on 30th March 2016,\navailable online:\u00a0http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/14473828.2016.1161960\u00a0\u00a0"},

This research article presents a qualitative research synthesis that identifies those interventions used by occupational therapists, internationally, which are viewed as effective from both clients' and carers' perspectives.\n\nMethod: Qualitative research synthesis was used to analyse, synthesize, and interpret results from qualitative studies. Twenty-two studies, collectively capturing client, carer, and occupational therapists' perspectives, were synthesized by the research team.\n\nFindings: The findings identified four themes, which indicated that the occupational therapist needs to exhibit professional artistry, facilitate occupational engagement, pace occupation to support the achievement of client goals and new horizons; and also recognized the importance of inclusion that promotes client participation and a sense of belonging in a range of socio-cultural contexts.\n\nConclusion: The use of occupational interventions that provide space for healing, self-rediscovery, identity formation, and community participation, were valued more than short, psychological-based interventions focused on case management and the assessment of mental stability, which were seen as superficial in scope. Occupational therapists need to demonstrate an authentic therapeutic relationship that is built upon care, trust, and respect, in order for interventions to have impact."},

Whilst there have been a number of initiatives in this area, there have been relatively few arts-informed evaluations of such interventions.

What is novel about the approach adopted here is that not only was the study user-guided, but the study also adopted a new and emerging form of arts-informed inquiry, which offered clarity to the evaluation that is not seen in some of the earlier methods available. The findings of the study indicate that theatre and performance provided opportunities for diverse marginalised members of a community to connect and participate in a shared activity and transform their views of themselves and others in ways that were beneficial for health and wellbeing."},

Yet realising this is not straightforward, especially in light of the amount and appropriateness of research evidence available and its relationship to practice, coupled with practitioners\u2019 own ideology about the contribution of propositional knowledge (the use of propositions, ideas and theories). Knowledge translation is a collaborative means of making the best use of knowledge resulting from theory, policy and research evidence to ensure delivery of best practice to clients and carers to improve health outcomes. This paper presents participatory action research (PAR) as a methodology to meet the challenge of engaging professional staff in knowledge translation to support practice demands through a considered process of reflection, dialogue and action with others. Insights demonstrating PAR methods and results for knowledge translation will be drawn from the literature and from first-hand experience of a professional practice development research project involving occupational therapists working across a health and academic setting in the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nThe principles and practice of PAR methodology, including a brief history of its purpose and development, are examined. Strategies for \u2018getting going\u2019, including consideration of research participant roles, examination of authentic participation and the process of analysis or meaning making are discussed.

This article reports on findings taken from a large-scale study that explored the socio-political impact of virtual world learning on higher education in the UK, specifically with regard to Second Life. Three dominant frames of reference emerged following analysis of data gathered from student and staff perspectives of their experience and use of Second Life, namely: (i) games and gaming media; (ii) disciplinary learning; and (iii) institutional space and ownership. Such frames of reference were evident in the practices of those involved in using virtual worlds, but it is suggested here that they have largely been overlooked in the literature in terms of their impact and how they may inform learner understandings. We argue that these frames of reference need to be recognised and located in the design and use of virtual worlds in higher education.
